1
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:21,429
I believe in America.

2
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,299
America has made my fortune

3
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:27,402
and I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:29,073 --> 00:01:31,837
I gave her freedom,
but I taught her

5
00:01:31,942 --> 00:01:34,442
never to dishonor her family.

6
00:01:35,312 --> 00:01:38,543
She found a boyfriend.
Not an Italian.

7
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:40,961
She went to the movies with him.

8
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:44,079
She stayed out late.
I didn't protest.

9
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,689
Two months ago,
he took her for a drive

10
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,292
with another boyfriend.

11
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:54,257
They made her drink whiskey,

12
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,562
and then they tried
to take advantage of her.

13
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,947
She resisted.

14
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:03,471
She kept her honor.

15
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,234
So they beat her like an animal.

16
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,877
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken...

17
00:02:14,185 --> 00:02:16,296
her jaw was shattered...

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,820
held together by wire.

19
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:23,418
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

20
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:29,755
But I wept. Why did I weep?

21
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:34,936
She was the light of my life.

22
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:39,307
Beautiful girl.

23
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:44,779
Now she will never
be beautiful again.

24
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,422
Sorry.

25
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:05,066
I, I went to the police,
like a good American.

26
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:08,636
These two boys
were brought to trial.

27
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,704
A judge sentence them
to three years in prison...

28
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,310
and suspend their sentence.

29
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,613
Suspended the sentence.

30
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:21,182
They went free that very day.

31
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:25,854
I stood in the courtroom
like a fool.

32
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:29,989
And those two bastard,
they smiled at me.

33
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:34,998
Then I said to my wife,
"For justice...

34
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,599
we must go to Don Corleone."

35
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:45,805
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

36
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:48,788
What do you want of me?

37
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,906
Tell me anything,
but do what I beg you to do.

38
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,617
What is that?

39
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,010
That I cannot do.

40
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:25,013
I'll give you anything you ask.

41
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:30,182
We've known each other many years,
but this is the first time...

42
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:33,620
you ever came to me
for counsel or for help.

43
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,659
I can't remember the last time
that you invited me...

44
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,260
to your house
for a cup of coffee...

45
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,994
even though my wife
is godmother to your only child.

46
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,346
But let's be frank.

47
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,870
You never wanted my friendship...

48
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,002
and you were afraid
to be in my debt.

49
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,610
I didn't want
to get into trouble.

50
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:59,214
I understand.

51
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:02,116
You found paradise in America.

52
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:06,900
You had a good trade,
you made a good living.

53
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:09,620
Police protected you,
and there were courts of law.

54
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,227
So you didn't need
a friend like me.

55
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,625
But, now you come to me
and you say,

56
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:20,235
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

57
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,839
But you don't ask with respect.

58
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:27,502
You don't offer friendship.

59
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:30,111
You don't even think
to call me 'Godfather.'

60
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,026
Instead, you come into my house

61
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,028
on the day my daughter
is to be married

62
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:37,552
and you ask me to do murder
for money.

63
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,949
I ask you for justice.

64
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,788
That is not justice.
Your daughter is still alive.

65
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,462
They must suffer then
as she suffers.

66
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:53,034
How much shall I pay you?

67
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:10,084
Bonasera. Bonasera.

68
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,989
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

69
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,354
If you'd come to me
in friendship,

70
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,441
then the scum
that ruined your daughter

71
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,965
would be suffering
this very day.

72
00:06:24,935 --> 00:06:26,179
And if, by chance,

73
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:28,248
an honest man like yourself
should make enemies,

74
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:30,772
then they would become
my enemies.

75
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:35,376
And then they would fear you.

76
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,950
Be my friend?

77
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,889
Godfather.

78
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:53,962
Good.

79
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,976
Someday, and that day
may never come...

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,500
I'll call upon you
to do a service for me.

81
00:07:01,305 --> 00:07:03,805
But until that day...

82
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:08,067
accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

83
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,046
<i>- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego</i>

84
00:07:19,089 --> 00:07:21,589
Give this to Clemenza.

85
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,505
I want reliable people,

86
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,707
people that aren't
going to be carried away.

87
00:07:27,731 --> 00:07:29,242
I mean, we're not murderers,

88
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:31,826
in spite of what
this undertaker says.

89
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,805
- Where's Michael?
- What? Don't worry.

90
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:00,573
It's early. He'll be here.

91
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:01,808
We're not taking it.

92
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:04,332
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

93
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,833
<i>No picture now.</i>

94
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,207
- What's the matter, Sonny?
- It's Michael.

95
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:05,726
Don Barzini.

96
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,227
<i>Welcome to our house.</i>

97
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:24,573
Hey, Paulie!
Let me have some wine.

98
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:27,241
Paulie! More wine.

99
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:28,595
<i>Scusi, please.</i>

100
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:30,430
You look terrif on the floor.

101
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,954
What are you,
a dance judge or something?

102
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:36,457
Go take a walk around
the neighborhood. Do your job.

103
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:45,979
Hey, Sandra, come on. Do me a favor.
Watch the kids.

104
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,963
- Don't let 'em run wild, all right?
- Well, you watch yourself, all right?

105
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:13,406
Twenty or thirty grand.

106
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,930
In small bills, cash.

107
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,766
In that little silk purse.

108
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,702
If this was
somebody else's wedding.

109
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,170
<i>Hey, Paulie!
I got two gobbagool...</i>

110
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:27,120
<i>gabagol and a prosciutto.</i>

111
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,644
Stupid jerk!

112
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:40,354
Hey, what's the matter?

113
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,313
- I have to go back to work.
- Oh, Tom.

114
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,648
It's part of the wedding.

115
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:58,573
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

116
00:11:04,614 --> 00:11:06,926
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

117
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,450
that you have invited me
to your home...

118
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:15,301
Get outta here.

119
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,825
This is a private party. Go on.

120
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,262
What is it?
Hey, my sister's wedding.

121
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:30,838
Goddamn FBI
don't respect nothin'.

122
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,809
Hey, come here, come here.
Come here!

123
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:40,681
There.

124
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:53,673
But towards the end
he was paroled...

125
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:56,325
to help with
the American war effort.

126
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,933
For the last six months, he's been
working at my pastry shop.

127
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,681
Nazorine, my friend,
what can I do for you?

128
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:04,205
Now that the war is over...

129
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:07,334
this boy, Enzo, they want
to repatriate him back to Italy.

130
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:11,005
Godfather, I have a daughter.

131
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,614
See, she and Enzo...

132
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,596
You want Enzo to stay
in this country...

133
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,120
and you want your daughter
to be married.

134
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,690
You understand everything.

135
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,893
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

136
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:30,443
And wait till you see
the beautiful wedding cake...

137
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:31,878
I made for your daughter.

138
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:34,462
Like this, with the bride
and the groom and...

139
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:43,804
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

140
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,109
Give it to a Jew congressman
in another district.

141
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:51,752
Who else is on the list?

142
00:12:57,894 --> 00:13:00,072
Hey, Michael. How are you?

143
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:02,596
Hello.

144
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:22,012
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

145
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,770
Is this... Is this necessary?

146
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:32,705
He didn't expect to be invited
to the wedding...

147
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,774
so he wanted to thank you.

148
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:36,475
All right.

149
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:39,730
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

150
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:42,336
that you have invited me
to your home...

151
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,939
on the wedding day
of your daughter.

152
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,842
And may their first child
be a masculine child.

153
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:50,469
- Don...
- Michael?

154
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,124
Don Corleone...

155
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,648
That man over there
is talking to himself.

156
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,052
See that scary guy over there?

157
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,866
He's a very scary guy.

158
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:02,201
Who is he? What's his name?

159
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,819
His name is Luca Brasi...

160
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,428
and he helps my father out
sometimes.

161
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:10,704
Oh, Michael, wait a minute.
He's coming over here.

162
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:11,705
Mike!

163
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,206
Ho! Tom.

164
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,730
Heyyy!

165
00:14:15,906 --> 00:14:17,783
You look terrific!

166
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,986
My brother Tom Hagen.
This is Kay Adams.

167
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,535
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

168
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:24,991
Your father's
been asking for you.

169
00:14:25,015 --> 00:14:26,735
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

170
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,259
I'll be there.

171
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,315
If he's your brother,
why does he have a different name?

172
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:35,401
Oh, uh, when my brother Sonny was a kid...

173
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:37,925
he found Tom Hagen in the street,
and he had no home.

174
00:14:38,828 --> 00:14:41,328
And so my father took him in...

175
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:44,398
and he's been with us ever since.

176
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,601
He's a good lawyer.

177
00:14:48,038 --> 00:14:50,383
Not a Sicilian, but...

178
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,718
I think he's gonna be consigliere.

179
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:55,242
- What's that?
- That's...

180
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,490
like a counselor, an advisor.

181
00:14:57,514 --> 00:15:00,014
Very important to the family.

182
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,083
You like your lasagne?

183
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:11,994
Don Corleone,
I am honored and grateful...

184
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:15,326
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding...

185
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:23,437
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.

186
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:27,207
And I hope
that their first child...

187
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,810
be a masculine child.

188
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:35,675
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

189
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:39,532
For your daughter's
bridal purse.

190
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,548
Thank you, Luca,
my most valued friend.

191
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,117
Don Corleone,
I'm gonna leave you now...

192
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,274
because I know you are busy.

193
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,798
Thank you.

194
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:57,288
Senator Cauly apologized
for not coming personally...

195
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:59,893
but said you'd understand.

196
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,730
Also some of the judges.

197
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,733
They've all sent gifts.

198
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,070
What is that outside?

199
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,709
Johnny!

200
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:26,153
I love you.

201
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,856
Hey, Johnny, look over here!

202
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,694
He came all the way from California
to come to the wedding.

203
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,040
- I told you he was going to come.
- It's been two years.

204
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:42,564
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

205
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:49,143
Sing a song.

206
00:19:03,326 --> 00:19:06,193
Michael, you never told me
you knew Johnny Fontane.

207
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:10,255
- Sure. You wanna meet him?
- Huh? Oh, well, sure.

208
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,411
My father helped him
with his career.

209
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:15,529
- For my Connie.
- He did? How?

210
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:17,383
<i>I have but one</i>

211
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,341
- Let's listen to the song.
- No, Michael

212
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:20,953
<i>Heart</i>

213
00:19:20,977 --> 00:19:24,674
<i>This heart I bring you</i>

214
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:30,616
<i>I have but one heart</i>

215
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,220
<i>To share with you</i>

216
00:19:35,692 --> 00:19:39,958
<i>I have but one dream</i>

217
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:43,658
<i>That I can cling to</i>

218
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:49,833
<i>You are the one dream</i>

219
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,204
<i>I pray comes true</i>

220
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:56,322
Please, Michael. Tell me.

221
00:19:56,346 --> 00:20:00,009
<i>My darling, until I saw you</i>

222
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,094
Well, when Johnny was first starting out...

223
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,985
he was signed to this
personal service contract...

224
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:07,588
with a big bandleader.

225
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:10,069
And as his career
got better and better...

226
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:12,593
he wanted to get out of it.

227
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,992
Now, Johnny is
my father's godson...

228
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:18,599
and my father went
to see this bandleader...

229
00:20:19,535 --> 00:20:22,035
and he offered him
$10,000 to let Johnny go.

230
00:20:23,506 --> 00:20:26,006
But the bandleader said no.

231
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,469
So the next day
my father went to see him...

232
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:32,079
only this time with Luca Brasi.

233
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:36,810
And within an hour,
he signed a release...

234
00:20:38,955 --> 00:20:41,583
for a certified check of $1,000.

235
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,436
How'd he do that?

236
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,985
My father made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

237
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:50,931
What was that?

238
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,763
Luca Brasi
held a gun to his head...

239
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,115
and my father assured him
that either his brains...

240
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:58,639
or his signature
would be on the contract.

241
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,713
That's a true story.

242
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:19,593
That's my family, Kay.
It's not me.

243
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:34,942
Beautiful!

244
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,230
My godson comes all the way
from California.

245
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:47,754
Give him a glass of wine.

246
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:08,976
I'll take care of it.

247
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:13,447
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

248
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:23,991
How are you, Fredo?

249
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:27,127
My brother Fredo.
This is Kay Adams.

250
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:30,731
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

251
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:35,699
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

252
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:38,305
Yeah. This is your friend, huh?

253
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:43,706
I don't know what to do.
My voice is, is weak.

254
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:46,125
It's weak.

255
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:48,777
Anyway, if I had this part
in the picture, you know...

256
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:51,513
it puts me right back
up on top again.

257
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,122
But this, uh...

258
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,369
this man out there,
he won't give it to me.

259
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:59,438
- The head of the studio.
- What's his name?

260
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,056
Woltz. Woltz.
He won't give it to me...

261
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:05,726
and he says
there's no chance, no chance.

262
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:12,239
Sonny?

263
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
Sonny?

264
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,482
Sonny?

265
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:24,211
Sonny, you in there?

266
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,953
- What?
- The old man wants to see you.

267
00:23:28,424 --> 00:23:30,924
All right, one minute.

268
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,666
A month ago, he bought
the movie rights to this book.

269
00:23:47,777 --> 00:23:49,588
A best-seller.

270
00:23:49,612 --> 00:23:51,890
And the main character
is a guy just like me.

271
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:54,414
Why, I wouldn't even
have to act.

272
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:55,894
Just be myself.

273
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:59,786
Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

274
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:04,126
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

275
00:24:05,461 --> 00:24:06,939
Is this how you turned out?

276
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:09,591
A Hollywood finocchio
that cries like a woman?

277
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,579
"What can I do?"
"What can I do?"

278
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:15,147
What is that nonsense?

279
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,671
Ridiculous!

280
00:24:21,644 --> 00:24:24,943
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

281
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,592
Good.

282
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:28,856
Because the man who doesn't
spend time with his family...

283
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,029
can never be a real man.

284
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,553
Come here.

285
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:39,526
You look terrible.
I want you to eat.

286
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,741
I want you to rest well,
and a month from now...

287
00:24:42,765 --> 00:24:45,893
this Hollywood big shot's
gonna give you what you want.

288
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:48,502
Too late.
They start shooting in a week.

289
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:51,772
I'm gonna make him an offer
he can't refuse.

290
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,256
Now just go outside,
enjoy yourself and...

291
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,874
forget about all this nonsense.

292
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,978
Listen. I want you
to leave it all to me.

293
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:07,421
All right.

294
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:33,410
What time does my daughter
leave with the bridegroom?

295
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:35,994
In a few minutes,
right after they cut the cake.

296
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:39,215
Now, your new son-in-law,
we give him something important.

297
00:25:39,322 --> 00:25:41,667
Never. Give him a living...

298
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:44,717
but never discuss
the family business with him.

299
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:46,204
What else?

300
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,806
Virgil Sollozzo called.

301
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,208
We have to give him a day
sometime next week.

302
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:52,732
We'll discuss him when you
come back from California.

303
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,080
When am I going to California?

304
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:57,182
I want you to go tonight.

305
00:25:57,206 --> 00:26:00,004
I want you to talk
to this movie big shot...

306
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:02,609
and settle this business
for Johnny.

307
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,547
Now if there's nothing else, I'd like
to go to my daughter's wedding.

308
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,419
Carlo, we're gonna take
the picture.

309
00:26:14,056 --> 00:26:15,867
Wait a minute.

310
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:18,391
No, Michael, not me.

311
00:26:21,297 --> 00:26:22,608
Just a little closer.

312
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:25,132
Okay, that's it.
Just like that now. Hold it.

313
00:28:09,972 --> 00:28:12,472
Isn't that nice?

314
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,157
All right, start talking.

315
00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:21,681
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

316
00:28:22,485 --> 00:28:25,147
This friend is my client and would
give his undying friendship...

317
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:28,985
to Mr. Woltz, if Mr. Woltz
would grant us a small favor.

318
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:31,570
Woltz is listening.

319
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:34,688
Give Johnny the part in that new
war film you're starting next week.

320
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,362
And what favor
would your friend...

321
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,351
grant Mr. Woltz?

322
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,253
You're gonna have
some union problems.

323
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:50,088
My client could make them disappear.

324
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:52,224
Also, one of your top stars
has just moved...

325
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:54,226
from marijuana to heroin.

326
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,228
- Are you trying to muscle me?
- Absolutely not.

327
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:58,630
Now listen to me,
you smooth-talking son of a bitch!

328
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,316
Let me lay it on the line for you
and your boss, whoever he is!

329
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,034
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie.

330
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:05,537
I don't care
how many dago, guinea, wop...

331
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,906
greaseball goombahs
come outta the woodwork.

332
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,174
I'm German-Irish.

333
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,792
Well, let me tell you something,
my kraut mick friend.

334
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:14,802
I'm going to make so much trouble for you,
you won't know what hit you.

335
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:16,882
Mr. Woltz, I'm a lawyer.
I have not threatened...

336
00:29:16,906 --> 00:29:19,807
I know almost every big lawyer
in New York. Who the hell are you?

337
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:23,140
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

338
00:29:23,245 --> 00:29:25,745
Now, you have my number.
I'll wait for your call.

339
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:29,649
By the way, I admire
your pictures very much.

340
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,090
Check him out.

341
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:01,414
- This is really beautiful.
- Look at this.

342
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:03,695
It used to decorate
the palace of a king.

343
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,997
Oh, yeah. Very nice.

344
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,649
Why didn't you say
you worked for Corleone, Tom?

345
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:11,002
I thought you were just
some cheap, two-bit hustler...

346
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,071
Johnny was running in,
trying to bluff me.

347
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:15,574
I don't like to use his name
unless it's really necessary.

348
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:17,175
- How's your drink, Tom?
- Fine.

349
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:20,279
Hey, come on over here with me. I want to
show you something really beautiful.

350
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:22,803
You do appreciate beauty,
don't you, Tom?

351
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,600
There you are.
$600,000 on four hooves.

352
00:30:28,711 --> 00:30:30,021
I'll bet Russian czars...

353
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,357
never paid that kind of dough
for a single horse.

354
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,881
Khartoum.

355
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,712
I'm not gonna race him, though.
I'm gonna put him out to stud.

356
00:30:41,824 --> 00:30:43,368
Beautiful.

357
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:45,036
- Thanks, Tony.
- You're welcome.

358
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,560
- Come on.
- Let's get something to eat.

359
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:51,531
Mr. Corleone
is Johnny's godfather.

360
00:30:52,501 --> 00:30:54,846
To the Italian people,
that's a very religious...

361
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,848
sacred, close relationship.

362
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:57,983
I respect that.

363
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:00,507
Just tell him he should ask me
anything else.

364
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,109
But this is one favor
I can't give him.

365
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:05,912
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

366
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:08,973
- Understood?
- You don't understand.

367
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,584
Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

368
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:16,685
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

369
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,770
I'm gonna run him
out of the business.

370
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:21,294
And let me tell you why.

371
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:25,660
Johnny Fontane ruined
one of Woltz International's...

372
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,746
most valuable protégés.

373
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,081
For five years,
we had her under training.

374
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:33,165
Singing lessons,
acting lessons, dancing lessons.

375
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:35,654
I spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars on her.

376
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:37,956
I was gonna make her a big star.

377
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,710
And let me be even more frank.

378
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,194
Just to show you that I'm not
a hard-hearted man...

379
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:45,743
that it's not all dollars and cents.

380
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:47,654
She was beautiful!

381
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,867
She was young, she was innocent!

382
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:51,870
She was the greatest piece of ass
I've ever had...

383
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:54,394
and I've had 'em all over the world!

384
00:31:55,097 --> 00:31:57,242
And then Johnny Fontane comes along...

385
00:31:57,266 --> 00:32:00,167
with his olive oil voice and guinea charm.

386
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,970
And she runs off.

387
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,332
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous...

388
00:32:08,544 --> 00:32:10,956
and a man in my position can't afford...

389
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,744
to be made to look ridiculous!

390
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,227
Now you get the hell outta here!

391
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:18,363
And if that goombah
tries any rough stuff...

392
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,887
you tell him I ain't no bandleader.

393
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:24,785
Yeah. I heard that story.

394
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:28,394
Thank you for the dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

395
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:32,426
If your car could take me
to the airport...

396
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:36,334
Mr. Corleone is a man who insists
on hearing bad news immediately.

397
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:32,981
- You're not too tired are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

398
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,588
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

399
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:38,725
Now...

400
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:42,028
Sollozzo is known as "The Turk."

401
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,043
He's supposed to be
very good with a knife...

402
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:46,845
<i>but only
in matters of business...</i>

403
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:49,369
<i>with some sort
of reasonable complaint.</i>

404
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,699
<i>His business is narcotics.</i>

405
00:34:52,808 --> 00:34:56,141
<i>He has fields in Turkey
where they grow the poppy...</i>

406
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:59,146
<i>and in Sicily he has the plants
to process them into heroin.</i>

407
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:03,816
<i>Now, he needs cash and he needs
protection from the police...</i>

408
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:05,997
<i>for which he gives
a piece of the action.</i>

409
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,999
<i>I couldn't find out how much.</i>

410
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,821
<i>The Tattaglia family
is behind him here in New York.</i>

411
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:13,071
<i>Now, they have to be
in it for something.</i>

412
00:35:13,095 --> 00:35:14,205
Santino Corleone.

413
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:16,074
What about his prison record?

414
00:35:16,098 --> 00:35:18,598
Two terms,
one in Italy, one here.

415
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,646
He's known as
a top narcotics man.

416
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,170
Santino, what do you think?

417
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:27,774
There's a lot of money
in that white powder.

418
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:30,388
Tom?

419
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:32,912
<i>Well, I say, yes, there's more
money potential in narcotics...</i>

420
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,959
<i>than anything else
we're looking at.</i>

421
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:37,395
<i>Now, if we don't get into it,
somebody else will.</i>

422
00:35:37,419 --> 00:35:39,531
<i>Maybe one of the five families,
maybe all of them.</i>

423
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:40,835
<i>Now, with the money they earn...</i>

424
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,089
they can buy more police
and political power.

425
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:46,371
Then they come after us.

426
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:49,159
Now we have the unions,
we have the gambling...

427
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:51,543
and they're the best things
to have, but narcotics...

428
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,044
is a thing of the future.

429
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,879
Now, if we don't get
a piece of that action...

430
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,381
we risk everything we have.

431
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,905
I mean, not now,
but ten years from now.

432
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:05,538
So? What's your answer
gonna be, Pop?

433
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:16,789
I need a man
who has powerful friends.

434
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:20,389
I need a million dollars in cash.

435
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:22,574
I need, Don Corleone,
those politicians...

436
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:26,261
that you carry in your pocket
like so many nickels and dimes.

437
00:36:27,836 --> 00:36:29,948
What is the interest
for my family?

438
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:31,883
Thirty percent.

439
00:36:31,907 --> 00:36:34,705
In the first year, your end
should be three, four million dollars.

440
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:38,511
And then it would go up.

441
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,614
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

442
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,120
My compliments.

443
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:52,553
I'll take care of the Tattaglias.
Outta my share.

444
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:56,258
So, I receive 30% for finance...

445
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,844
political influence
and legal protection.

446
00:36:59,868 --> 00:37:02,368
- That's what you're telling me.
- That's right.

447
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:08,175
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

448
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:11,212
If you consider
a million dollars in cash...

449
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,490
just "finance"...

450
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:15,514
<i>I salute you, Don Corleone.</i>

451
00:37:26,361 --> 00:37:29,296
I said that I would see you because...

452
00:37:29,398 --> 00:37:31,576
I heard that you were
a serious man...

453
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,100
to be treated with respect.

454
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,937
But I must say no to you.

455
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:45,556
And I'll give you my reason.

456
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,378
It's true, I have
a lot of friends in politics.

457
00:37:50,052 --> 00:37:52,030
But they wouldn't be friendly
very long...

458
00:37:52,054 --> 00:37:54,399
if they knew my business was drugs
instead of gambling...

459
00:37:54,423 --> 00:37:57,620
which they regard
as a harmless vice.

460
00:37:57,726 --> 00:38:00,354
- But drugs is a dirty business.
- No, Don Corleone...

461
00:38:00,462 --> 00:38:02,440
It doesn't make
any difference to me...

462
00:38:02,464 --> 00:38:05,228
what a man does for a living,
you understand...

463
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:07,834
but your business is...

464
00:38:08,904 --> 00:38:10,615
a little dangerous.

465
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:13,117
If you're worried about security
for your million...

466
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:14,819
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

467
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:17,573
You're tellin' me the Tattaglias
guarantee our investment...

468
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,179
Wait a minute.

469
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:28,232
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children...

470
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:30,568
and I spoil them,
as you can see.

471
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:32,270
They talk when they should listen.

472
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:34,405
But anyway...

473
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,929
Signor Sollozzo,
my no is final...

474
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:39,796
and I wish to congratulate you
on your new business.

475
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:43,166
I know you'll do very well,
and good luck to you...

476
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:46,240
especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine.

477
00:38:47,676 --> 00:38:50,176
Thank you.

478
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:13,132
Come here.

479
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:16,714
What's the matter with you?

480
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:18,516
I think your brain
is going soft...

481
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,407
from all that comedy you're
playing with that young girl.

482
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,911
Never tell anybody outside the
family what you're thinking again.

483
00:39:27,082 --> 00:39:29,582
Go on.

484
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,050
Tom, what?
What is this nonsense?

485
00:39:35,157 --> 00:39:37,657
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

486
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,173
Well, take it away.

487
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:44,697
Take it over there.

488
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,412
And...

489
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:49,936
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

490
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:58,940
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

491
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:02,414
I want you to find out what he's got
under his fingernails, you know?

492
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,296
Go to the Tattaglias...

493
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,632
and make them think...

494
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:11,353
that you're not too happy
with our family...

495
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:14,961
and find out what you can.

496
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,739
And I got something
for your mother and for Sonny...

497
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,895
and a tie for Freddy...

498
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:40,615
and Tom Hagen
got the Reynolds pen.

499
00:40:40,722 --> 00:40:42,800
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Me?

500
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:45,324
Oh, just you.

501
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:19,637
Tell Paulie to get the car.
We're going.

502
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:21,072
Okay, Pa.

503
00:41:21,096 --> 00:41:23,997
I'll have to get it myself, Pa.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

504
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:29,502
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind gettin' the car.

505
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:22,011
Luca, I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

506
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,568
I know.

507
00:42:23,592 --> 00:42:26,092
Scotch? Prewar.

508
00:42:32,267 --> 00:42:33,767
You know who I am?

509
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:35,199
I know you.

510
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:40,079
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family... right?

511
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,079
I think you and I can do business.

512
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:49,589
I need someone strong like you.

513
00:42:50,209 --> 00:42:53,049
I heard you are not happy...

514
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:55,759
...with the Corleone family.

515
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:58,259
Want to join me?

516
00:42:59,429 --> 00:43:01,389
What's in it for me?

517
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:06,939
$50,000 to start with.

518
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:10,189
Not bad!

519
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:13,489
Agreed?

520
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:14,879
Oh. Tom Hagen.

521
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,681
- Merry Christmas.
- Yeah.

522
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:19,640
I'm glad I run into you.
I wanna talk to you.

523
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,619
I haven't got time.

524
00:44:21,643 --> 00:44:24,407
Oh, make time, consigliere.
Get in the car.

525
00:44:26,514 --> 00:44:28,092
What are you worried about?

526
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:30,616
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

527
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,919
Get in.

528
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,900
<i>Wait a moment, Fredo.</i>

529
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,601
- I'm gonna buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pa.

530
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:55,619
Hi. Merry Christmas.

531
00:44:55,643 --> 00:44:58,143
I want some fruit over there.

532
00:45:00,882 --> 00:45:03,382
Gimme three of them.

533
00:45:04,486 --> 00:45:06,986
No, that one.

534
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:27,606
Fredo!

535
00:46:14,255 --> 00:46:16,755
Papa.

536
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:19,291
Papa!

537
00:46:24,132 --> 00:46:26,896
Mike, would you like me better
if I were a nun...

538
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:29,501
like in the story, you know?

539
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,740
No.

540
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:35,742
Well, then would you like me better
if I were Ingrid Bergman?

541
00:46:35,844 --> 00:46:38,344
Now that's a thought.

542
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:40,715
Michael.

543
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:44,647
No, I would not like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

544
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:47,252
- Michael.
- What's the matter?

545
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:05,537
They don't say
if he's dead or alive.

546
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:29,634
Sonny, Michael.

547
00:47:29,658 --> 00:47:31,058
<i>Michael, where you been?</i>

548
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:32,810
Is he all right?

549
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:35,564
<i>We don't know yet.
There's all kinds of stories.</i>

550
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:39,605
<i>He was hit bad, Mikey.</i>

551
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:43,169
<i>- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.</i>

552
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:45,689
<i>Where you been? I was worried.</i>

553
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,858
Didn't Tom tell you? I called.

554
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:51,613
<i>No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?</i>

555
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:54,219
All right.

556
00:47:59,928 --> 00:48:02,428
Oh, my God.

557
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:18,911
Who is it?

558
00:48:19,013 --> 00:48:21,513
Open up. It's Clemenza.

559
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:23,560
What?

560
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:26,084
There's more news about your old man.

561
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:28,599
The word is out on the street
he's already dead.

562
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:30,601
Shut your mouth.
What's the matter with you?

563
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:33,125
Jesus Christ!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

564
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:35,339
- Where was Paulie?
- Paulie was out sick.

565
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:37,883
- He's been home sick all winter.
- How many times he been sick?

566
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:39,476
Only maybe three, four times.

567
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,740
I mean, I asked Freddy if he wants
a different bodyguard.

568
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:43,280
- He said no.
- Pick him up right now.

569
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:45,115
I don't care how sick he is.

570
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:47,885
If he's breathin', I want you to bring him
to my father's house now. You understand? Now

571
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,707
- You want me to send people here?
- No, just you and him. Go ahead.

572
00:48:50,812 --> 00:48:53,312
All right.

573
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:03,522
I'm havin' a couple of our people come
over to the house. A couple of our people.

574
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:09,373
<i>- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?</i>

575
00:49:09,397 --> 00:49:11,897
<i>- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.</i>

576
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:16,003
<i>In about three hours, he'll be
released with our proposition.</i>

577
00:49:16,104 --> 00:49:19,471
<i>Listen to everything he has
to say before you do anything.</i>

578
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:21,185
<i>What's done is done.</i>

579
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:24,178
<i>And don't lose that famous temper
of yours, huh, Sonny?</i>

580
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,778
No, I'll wait.

581
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:42,794
Your boss is dead.

582
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:47,578
I know you're not in the muscle
end of the family, Tom...

583
00:49:47,602 --> 00:49:50,102
so I don't want you to be scared.

584
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:53,196
I want you
to help the Corleones...

585
00:49:53,307 --> 00:49:55,807
and I want you to help me.

586
00:49:58,379 --> 00:50:00,190
Yeah. We got him outside his office...

587
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:02,714
just about an hour after we picked you up.

588
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:07,052
Drink it.

589
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:13,627
So now it's up to you to make
the peace between me and Sonny.

590
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:20,666
Sonny was hot
for my deal, wasn't he?

591
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,570
And you knew it was
the right thing to do.

592
00:50:26,407 --> 00:50:28,907
Sonny will come after you
with everything he's got.

593
00:50:29,677 --> 00:50:32,177
That'll be his first reaction, sure.

594
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,325
That's why you gotta
talk some sense into him.

595
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:38,580
The Tattaglia family is behind me
with all their people.

596
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:41,835
The other New York families
will go along with anything...

597
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:44,359
that will prevent a full-scale war.

598
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,137
Let's face it, Tom,
in all due respect...

599
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:49,721
the Don, rest in peace, was slippin'.

600
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,133
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

601
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:01,151
Well, now he's dead.

602
00:51:01,175 --> 00:51:03,675
He's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

603
00:51:05,313 --> 00:51:07,424
So you gotta talk to Sonny.

604
00:51:07,448 --> 00:51:09,359
You gotta talk
to the caporegimes...

605
00:51:09,383 --> 00:51:11,883
that Tessio, and that fat Clemenza.

606
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,790
It's good business, Tom.

607
00:51:19,727 --> 00:51:22,005
I'll try.

608
00:51:22,029 --> 00:51:24,691
But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

609
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:30,202
Yeah. Well...

610
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,505
Let me worry about Luca.

611
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:40,791
You just talk to Sonny.

612
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:43,315
And the other two kids.

613
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:48,031
I'll do my best.

614
00:51:48,055 --> 00:51:50,555
Good.

615
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,859
Now, you can go.

616
00:52:00,735 --> 00:52:04,068
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

617
00:52:05,606 --> 00:52:08,106
Blood is a big expense.

618
00:52:29,197 --> 00:52:31,074
He's still alive.

619
00:52:31,098 --> 00:52:33,598
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

620
00:52:35,102 --> 00:52:37,080
Well, that's bad luck for me...

621
00:52:37,104 --> 00:52:39,604
and bad luck for you
if you don't make that deal.

622
00:53:24,585 --> 00:53:26,630
Your mother's over
in the hospital with your father.

623
00:53:26,654 --> 00:53:29,154
Looks like he's gonna
pull through, thank God.

624
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:33,470
- That's a lot of bad blood.
- What do you think?

625
00:53:33,494 --> 00:53:36,361
It's too far.
I think it's too personal.

626
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:39,126
- The Don will consider this over.
- You gonna kill all those guys?

627
00:53:39,233 --> 00:53:41,873
- Hey, stay out of it, Mickey, do me a favor.
- Sollozzo's the key.

628
00:53:41,897 --> 00:53:44,014
You get rid of him,
everything falls into line.

629
00:53:44,038 --> 00:53:46,632
What about Luca? Sollozzo
didn't seem worried about Luca.

630
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:52,108
I don't know. If Luca sold out,
we're in a lot of trouble.

631
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:54,258
Has anyone been able
to get in touch with Luca?

632
00:53:54,282 --> 00:53:56,360
We've been tryin' all night.
He might be shacked up.

633
00:53:56,384 --> 00:53:57,427
Hey, Mick, try him again.

634
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,096
Luca never sleeps over
with a broad.

635
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,620
He always goes home
when he's through.

636
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,125
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.

637
00:54:05,226 --> 00:54:08,354
What do we do
if the old man dies, God forbid?

638
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:10,962
If we lose the old man...

639
00:54:11,732 --> 00:54:14,667
we lose our political contacts
and half our strength.

640
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:17,670
The other New York families might
wind up supporting Sollozzo...

641
00:54:17,772 --> 00:54:20,117
just to avoid a long destructive war.

642
00:54:20,141 --> 00:54:23,872
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

643
00:54:25,112 --> 00:54:27,612
If your father dies...

644
00:54:28,949 --> 00:54:30,694
you'll make the deal, Sonny.

645
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:33,278
You know, that's easy for you to say,
Tom. He's not your father.

646
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:35,887
I was as much a son to him
as you or Mike.

647
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:42,806
What is it?

648
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:45,275
Hey, Paulie, I thought
I told you to stay put.

649
00:54:45,299 --> 00:54:47,927
Well, the guy at the gates,
they say they got a package.

650
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:50,535
Yeah? Tessio, go see what it is.

651
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:55,886
- You want me to hang around?
- Yeah, hang around.

652
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,387
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

653
00:54:57,411 --> 00:55:00,107
Yeah? There's some food
in the icebox. You hungry or anything?

654
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,259
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
- How 'bout a drink? How 'bout a little brandy?

655
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:04,203
- That's good to sweat it out.
- All right, sure.

656
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:06,727
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

657
00:55:08,255 --> 00:55:10,755
I want you to take care
of that son of a bitch right away.

658
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:13,316
Paulie sold out the old man, that strutz.

659
00:55:13,427 --> 00:55:16,521
I don't wanna see him again. Make that
first thing on your list, understand?

660
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:17,941
Understood.

661
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:20,277
Hey, Mickey, tomorrow.
You get a couple of guys.

662
00:55:20,301 --> 00:55:23,062
You go over to Luca's apartment. Hang
around. Wait for him to show up.

663
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,564
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

664
00:55:26,674 --> 00:55:28,919
Yeah.

665
00:55:28,943 --> 00:55:32,470
Listen, hang around the house
on the phone. It'll be a big help.

666
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:36,081
Try Luca again. Go ahead.

667
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:47,258
- What the hell is this?
- It's a Sicilian message.

668
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:49,861
It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

669
00:56:03,644 --> 00:56:06,144
- I'm goin' now.
- What time you gonna be home tonight?

670
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,680
I don't know. Probably late.

671
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:13,477
- Don't forget the cannoli.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

672
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,990
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rearview mirror.

673
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:23,707
That Sonny's runnin' wild.

674
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:25,776
He's thinkin' of goin'
to the mattresses already.

675
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,360
We gotta find a spot
over on the West Side.

676
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,563
We'll try 309 West 43rd Street.

677
00:56:31,672 --> 00:56:34,017
You know any good spots
on the West Side?

678
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:36,921
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Well, think about it while you're drivin'.

679
00:56:36,945 --> 00:56:38,889
I wanna hit New York sometime this month.

680
00:56:38,913 --> 00:56:41,413
And watch out for the kids
when you're backin' out.

681
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:54,204
Hey, Paulie, I want you to go
down 39th Street. Colosanto's.

682
00:56:54,228 --> 00:56:57,288
You pick up 18 mattresses for the guys
to sleep, will you? Bring me the bill.

683
00:56:57,398 --> 00:57:00,299
- Yeah, all right.
- Make sure they're clean because...

684
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:03,598
Those guys are gonna be stuck up
in there for a long time, you know?

685
00:57:03,704 --> 00:57:05,882
They're clean. They told me
they exterminate them.

686
00:57:05,906 --> 00:57:07,984
"Exterminate"?
That's a bad word to use.

687
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,977
Exterminate. Get this guy.
See how we don't exterminate you.

688
00:57:11,078 --> 00:57:13,578
<i>- Youse funny, or what?
- Hey, Paulie. Did you fart?</i>

689
00:57:14,782 --> 00:57:17,282
- Yeah, Rocco, what'd you do?
- No, me. Nothin'. It wasn't me.

690
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:19,396
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, pull over, will you.

691
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,920
I gotta take a leak.

692
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:04,908
Leave the gun.

693
00:58:04,932 --> 00:58:07,432
Take the cannoli.

694
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,721
<i>Hey, Mike?</i>

695
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:27,722
<i>Hey, Mikey?</i>

696
00:58:29,223 --> 00:58:30,223
Yeah?

697
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:31,723
<i>You're wanted on the telephone.</i>

698
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,931
- Who is it?
- It's some girl.

699
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:45,181
Hello, Kay?

700
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:46,550
<i>How's your father?</i>

701
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:48,351
He's good. He's gonna make it.

702
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:50,852
<i>I love you.</i>

703
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:51,876
Huh?

704
00:58:52,179 --> 00:58:54,179
<i>I love you!</i>

705
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:55,916
<i>Michael?</i>

706
00:58:56,294 --> 00:58:57,294
Yeah, I know.

707
00:58:57,318 --> 00:58:59,095
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

708
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,796
Yeah, I can't talk.

709
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,620
<i>Can't you say it?</i>

710
00:59:03,424 --> 00:59:05,924
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

711
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,118
Hey, Mikey. Why don't you tell
that nice girl you love her?

712
00:59:09,229 --> 00:59:11,274
I love you with all o' my heart!

713
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:13,823
If I don't see you again a-soon,
I'm-a gonna die!

714
00:59:15,069 --> 00:59:17,047
Come over here, kid.
Learn somethin'.

715
00:59:17,071 --> 00:59:19,571
You never know. You might have to cook
for 20 guys someday.

716
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:22,385
You see? You start out
with a little bit of oil.

717
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:23,954
Then you fry some garlic.

718
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,606
Then you throw in some tomatoes,
some tomato paste.

719
00:59:26,714 --> 00:59:29,376
You fry it.
You make sure it doesn't stick.

720
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:32,646
When you got it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and your meatballs.

721
00:59:35,522 --> 00:59:38,022
Add a little bit of wine.

722
00:59:40,861 --> 00:59:43,762
And a little bit of sugar.

723
00:59:44,469 --> 00:59:46,509
- And that's my trick.
- Why don't you cut the crap?

724
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:48,678
I got more important things
for you to do.

725
00:59:48,702 --> 00:59:51,296
- How's Paulie?
- Oh, Paulie. Won't see him no more.

726
00:59:53,374 --> 00:59:55,852
- Where you going?
- To the city.

727
00:59:55,876 --> 00:59:57,520
Send some bodyguards with him.

728
00:59:57,544 --> 00:59:59,522
- No. I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop.
- Nevermind. Send somebody with him.

729
00:59:59,546 --> 01:00:02,447
Oh, he'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

730
01:00:02,549 --> 01:00:05,049
- All right. Be careful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

731
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:10,555
Send somebody with him anyway.

732
01:00:38,752 --> 01:00:40,563
I have to go.

733
01:00:40,587 --> 01:00:43,087
Can I go with you?

734
01:00:43,424 --> 01:00:45,984
No, Kay. There's gonna be
detectives there.

735
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:48,071
People from the press.

736
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:50,595
Well, I'll ride in a cab.

737
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:55,099
I don't want you to get involved.

738
01:00:57,771 --> 01:01:00,271
When will I see you again?

739
01:01:06,447 --> 01:01:08,425
Go back to New Hampshire...

740
01:01:08,449 --> 01:01:10,949
and I'll call you
at your parents' house.

741
01:01:12,286 --> 01:01:14,786
When will I see you again,
Michael?

742
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,790
I don't know.

743
01:03:28,822 --> 01:03:30,934
What are you doing here?

744
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:33,036
You're not supposed
to be here now.

745
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:36,621
I'm Michael Corleone.
This is my father.

746
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:39,290
There's nobody here.
What happened to the guards?

747
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:41,711
Your father just had
too many visitors.

748
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,636
They interfered
with hospital service.

749
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,639
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

750
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:56,481
Get me Long Beach 4-5-6-2-0, please.

751
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:01,586
Nurse, wait a minute. Stay here.

752
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,737
Sonny, Michael.
I'm at the hospital.

753
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,321
Listen. I got here late.
There's nobody here.

754
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,422
Nobody. No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody.

755
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:16,331
<i>- Pop is all alone.
- Don't panic. We'll send somebody.</i>

756
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:18,748
I won't panic.

757
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:21,332
I'm sorry, but you will
have to leave.

758
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:27,008
You and I are gonna move my father
to another room.

759
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:30,174
Now, can you disconnect those tubes
so we can move the bed out?

760
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:33,776
- That's out of the question.
- Do you know my father?

761
01:04:33,887 --> 01:04:36,065
Men are coming here to kill him.

762
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:38,201
You understand?

763
01:04:38,225 --> 01:04:40,725
Now, help me, please.

764
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:01,803
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo... the baker.

765
01:06:01,908 --> 01:06:03,386
- You remember me?
- Enzo?

766
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,290
- Yes, Enzo.
- You better get out of here, Enzo.

767
01:06:05,314 --> 01:06:07,223
There's gonna be trouble.

768
01:06:07,247 --> 01:06:09,726
If there is trouble,
I stay here to help you...

769
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,250
For your father. For your father.

770
01:06:13,253 --> 01:06:15,064
All right, listen.

771
01:06:15,088 --> 01:06:17,233
Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital.

772
01:06:17,257 --> 01:06:20,260
All right? I'll be out
in a minute. Go ahead.

773
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:21,684
Okay, okay.

774
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:38,507
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

775
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:42,213
I'm with you now.

776
01:06:43,383 --> 01:06:45,883
I'm with you.

777
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,920
Get rid of these. Come here.

778
01:07:23,256 --> 01:07:25,756
Put your hand in your pocket
like you have a gun.

779
01:07:26,426 --> 01:07:28,926
You'll be all right.

780
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,700
You'll be okay.

781
01:08:19,412 --> 01:08:21,912
You did good.

782
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:57,193
Here he is.

783
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:59,717
All right, hold still.

784
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,574
I thought I got
all you guinea hoods locked up.

785
01:09:11,598 --> 01:09:13,042
What the hell are you doing here?

786
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:15,566
What happened to the men who
were guarding my father, Captain?

787
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,547
Why, you little punk.

788
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:19,611
What the hell are you doing,
telling me my business?

789
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:21,450
I pulled them guys off of here.

790
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:24,466
Now, you get out of here
and stay away from this hospital.

791
01:09:24,578 --> 01:09:27,547
I'm not moving until you put
some guards around my father's room.

792
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:30,226
Phil, take him in.

793
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,662
The kid's clean, Captain.
He's a war hero.

794
01:09:32,686 --> 01:09:35,587
- He's never been busted...
- Goddamn it, I said take him in.

795
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:40,216
What's the Turk paying you
to set up my father, Captain?

796
01:09:41,528 --> 01:09:43,639
Take a hold of him.
Stand him up.

797
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:46,163
Stand him up straight.

798
01:10:08,054 --> 01:10:10,099
I'm the attorney
for the Corleone family.

799
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:12,853
These men are private detectives
hired to protect Vito Corleone.

800
01:10:13,727 --> 01:10:15,471
They're licensed to carry firearms.

801
01:10:15,495 --> 01:10:17,995
If you interfere, you'll have to
appear before a judge...

802
01:10:18,064 --> 01:10:20,624
in the morning and show cause.

803
01:10:20,734 --> 01:10:23,234
All right, let him go.

804
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,803
Come on.

805
01:10:55,268 --> 01:10:57,246
What's with all the new faces?

806
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:59,081
Gonna need 'em now.

807
01:10:59,105 --> 01:11:01,733
After the hospital thing,
Sonny got mad.

808
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:04,969
We hit Bruno Tattaglia
at 4:00 this morning.

809
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:08,779
Jesus Christ.

810
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:17,621
Looks like a fortress around here.

811
01:11:22,128 --> 01:11:25,029
A hundred button men on the street,
24 hours a day.

812
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:28,362
That Turk shows one hair
on his ass, he's dead. Believe me.

813
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:33,470
Hey, Mike, come here.
Let me look at you.

814
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:38,587
You look beautiful.
Just beautiful.

815
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:40,089
You're gorgeous.

816
01:11:40,113 --> 01:11:42,809
Hey, listen to this.
The Turk, he wants to talk.

817
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:45,646
Imagine the nerve
on this son of a bitch.

818
01:11:45,752 --> 01:11:48,064
Craps out last night,
he wants a meeting today.

819
01:11:48,088 --> 01:11:50,588
- What'd he say?
- What did he say?

820
01:11:51,257 --> 01:11:53,402
He wants us to send Michael
to hear the proposition.

821
01:11:53,426 --> 01:11:56,486
And the promise is that the deal
is so good that we can't refuse.

822
01:11:57,097 --> 01:11:58,741
What about Bruno Tattaglia?

823
01:11:58,765 --> 01:12:00,409
That's part of the deal.

824
01:12:00,433 --> 01:12:02,411
Bruno cancels out what they did
to my father.

825
01:12:02,435 --> 01:12:04,935
Sonny, we ought to hear
what they have to say.

826
01:12:05,272 --> 01:12:07,750
No. No. No. No more.
Not this time, Consigliere.

827
01:12:07,774 --> 01:12:11,335
No more meetings, no more discussions,
no more Sollozzo tricks.

828
01:12:11,444 --> 01:12:13,255
You give them one message...
I want Sollozzo.

829
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:14,924
If not, it's all-out war.
We go to the mattresses.

830
01:12:14,948 --> 01:12:17,028
Some of the other families
won't sit still for a war.

831
01:12:17,052 --> 01:12:19,532
- Then they hand me Sollozzo.
- Your father wouldn't hear this.

832
01:12:19,556 --> 01:12:21,845
- This is business, not personal.
- They shot my father.

833
01:12:21,955 --> 01:12:25,356
Even shooting your father
was business, not personal, Sonny.

834
01:12:25,458 --> 01:12:27,458
Well, then business will have to suffer.
All right?

835
01:12:27,482 --> 01:12:29,105
And do me a favor, Tom...

836
01:12:29,129 --> 01:12:31,107
No more advice on how
to patch things up.

837
01:12:31,131 --> 01:12:33,631
Just help me win, please.
All right?

838
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:42,132
I found out about this Captain McCluskey
who broke Mike's jaw.

839
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:43,719
What about him?

840
01:12:43,743 --> 01:12:46,803
Now he's definitely on Sollozzo's
payroll, and for big money.

841
01:12:46,913 --> 01:12:49,814
McCluskey has agreed
to be the Turk's bodyguard.

842
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,894
What you have to understand,
Sonny...

843
01:12:51,918 --> 01:12:54,063
is that while Sollozzo's
being guarded like this...

844
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:55,898
he is invulnerable.

845
01:12:55,922 --> 01:12:59,483
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain. Never.

846
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:02,652
It would be disastrous. All the
five families would come after you, Sonny.

847
01:13:02,762 --> 01:13:05,492
The Corleone family
would be outcast.

848
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:09,295
Even the old man's political
protection would run for cover.

849
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,915
So do me a favor.

850
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:15,567
Take this into consideration.

851
01:13:18,378 --> 01:13:20,878
All right, we'll wait.

852
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:28,097
We can't wait.

853
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:30,099
Can't wait.

854
01:13:30,123 --> 01:13:31,883
I don't care what Sollozzo says
about a deal.

855
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,036
He's gonna kill Pop. That's it.

856
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:35,871
That's the key for him.

857
01:13:35,895 --> 01:13:37,873
Got to get Sollozzo.

858
01:13:37,897 --> 01:13:40,042
CLEMENZA: Mike is right.

859
01:13:40,066 --> 01:13:42,044
Let me ask you something first.

860
01:13:42,068 --> 01:13:45,128
What about this McCluskey?

861
01:13:45,238 --> 01:13:47,738
What do we do with this cop here?

862
01:13:52,078 --> 01:13:54,578
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

863
01:13:56,082 --> 01:13:58,642
It will be me...

864
01:13:58,751 --> 01:14:01,251
McCluskey and Sollozzo.

865
01:14:02,255 --> 01:14:04,755
Let's set the meeting.

866
01:14:06,426 --> 01:14:09,827
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

867
01:14:11,931 --> 01:14:15,662
Now we insist it's a public place...
a bar, a restaurant.

868
01:14:15,768 --> 01:14:19,499
Some place where there's people,
so I feel safe.

869
01:14:22,442 --> 01:14:25,343
They're gonna search me
when I first meet them, right?

870
01:14:25,445 --> 01:14:27,945
So I can't have a weapon on me then.

871
01:14:31,117 --> 01:14:33,617
But if Clemenza can figure a way...

872
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:36,220
to have a weapon
planted there for me...

873
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,560
then I'll kill them both.

874
01:14:55,441 --> 01:14:57,966
What are you gonna do?
Nice college boy, huh?

875
01:14:58,055 --> 01:15:00,055
Didn't want to get mixed up
in the family business.

876
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,057
Now you want to gun down
a police captain?

877
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,098
Why? 'Cause he slapped you
in the face a little bit?

878
01:15:04,122 --> 01:15:06,434
What do you think this is, the army,
where you shoot them a mile away?

879
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,063
You gotta get up close,
like this and...

880
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,488
You blow their brains all over your
nice Ivy League suit. Come here.

881
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:13,903
You're taking this very personal.

882
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:17,158
Tom, this is business, and this man
is taking it very, very personal.

883
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:19,275
Where does it say that
you can't kill a cop?

884
01:15:19,299 --> 01:15:21,824
- Come on, Mikey.
- Tom, wait a minute.

885
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:24,665
I'm talking about a cop
that's mixed up in drugs.

886
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:28,901
I'm talking about a dishonest cop,
a crooked cop...

887
01:15:29,008 --> 01:15:31,875
who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming to him.

888
01:15:31,978 --> 01:15:34,023
That's a terrific story.

889
01:15:34,047 --> 01:15:36,777
Now we have newspaper people
on the payroll, don't we, Tom?

890
01:15:38,318 --> 01:15:40,529
They might like a story like that.

891
01:15:40,553 --> 01:15:43,053
They might. They just might.

892
01:15:45,892 --> 01:15:48,037
It's not personal, Sonny.

893
01:15:48,061 --> 01:15:50,561
It's strictly business.

894
01:15:52,565 --> 01:15:54,209
It's as cold as they come.

895
01:15:54,233 --> 01:15:57,794
Impossible to trace, so you don't
worry about prints, Mike.

896
01:15:57,904 --> 01:16:00,805
I put a special tape
on the trigger and the butt.

897
01:16:00,907 --> 01:16:03,407
Here. Try it.

898
01:16:14,087 --> 01:16:16,587
What's the matter,
the trigger too tight?

899
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:21,904
- My ears.
- I left it noisy.

900
01:16:21,928 --> 01:16:26,661
That way it scares pain-in-the-ass
innocent bystanders away.

901
01:16:26,766 --> 01:16:29,266
All right, you shot them both.
Now what do you do?

902
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,016
Sit down, finish my dinner.

903
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,684
Come on, kid. Don't fool around.

904
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:39,269
Just let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

905
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:41,523
Everybody will still think
you got it.

906
01:16:41,547 --> 01:16:43,692
They're gonna be staring
at your face, Mike...

907
01:16:43,716 --> 01:16:46,776
so walk out of the place real fast,
but you don't run.

908
01:16:46,886 --> 01:16:50,287
Don't look nobody directly in the
eye, but you don't look away, either.

909
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,590
Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff
of you, believe me...

910
01:16:52,614 --> 01:16:55,114
so don't worry about nothing.

911
01:16:56,062 --> 01:16:57,873
You know, you're gonna turn out all right.

912
01:16:57,897 --> 01:17:00,209
You take a long vacation,
nobody knows where...

913
01:17:00,233 --> 01:17:02,711
and we're gonna catch the hell.

914
01:17:02,735 --> 01:17:04,880
How bad do you think
it's gonna be?

915
01:17:04,904 --> 01:17:06,882
Pretty goddamn bad.

916
01:17:06,906 --> 01:17:09,966
Probably all the other families
will line up against us.

917
01:17:10,076 --> 01:17:12,977
That's all right. These things
gotta happen every five years or so.

918
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:15,639
Ten years.
Helps to get rid of the bad blood.

919
01:17:15,748 --> 01:17:18,308
Been ten years since
the last one.

920
01:17:18,418 --> 01:17:20,396
You know, you gotta stop them
at the beginning...

921
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:22,564
like they should have
stopped Hitler at Munich.

922
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:24,566
They should have never let him
get away with that.

923
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:27,090
They was just asking
for big trouble.

924
01:17:27,427 --> 01:17:29,987
You know, Mike,
we was all proud of you...

925
01:17:30,096 --> 01:17:31,840
being a hero and all.

926
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:34,364
Your father too.

927
01:18:11,738 --> 01:18:13,549
Nothing. Not a hint.

928
01:18:13,573 --> 01:18:16,073
Absolutely nothing.

929
01:18:16,242 --> 01:18:19,143
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting's going to be held.

930
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:22,913
How much time do we have?

931
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,830
Gonna pick you up in front
of Jack Dempsey's joint...

932
01:18:25,854 --> 01:18:28,354
in an hour and a half...
exactly an hour and a half.

933
01:18:29,756 --> 01:18:32,256
We could put a tail on them,
see how it turns out.

934
01:18:32,358 --> 01:18:35,589
Sollozzo'll lose our ass
going around the block.

935
01:18:35,695 --> 01:18:37,206
What about the negotiator?

936
01:18:37,230 --> 01:18:39,926
He's over at my place playing
pinochle with a couple of my men.

937
01:18:40,032 --> 01:18:41,810
He's happy.
They're letting him win.

938
01:18:41,834 --> 01:18:45,463
It's too much of a risk for Mike.
Maybe we ought to call it off, Sonny.

939
01:18:45,571 --> 01:18:49,132
The negotiator keeps on playing cards
until Mike comes back safe and sound.

940
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,520
So why don't they just blast who's ever
in the goddamn car?

941
01:18:51,544 --> 01:18:53,522
Too dangerous.
They'll be looking for that.

942
01:18:53,546 --> 01:18:56,046
Sollozzo might not
even be in the car, Sonny.

943
01:18:56,716 --> 01:18:59,216
I get it.

944
01:19:08,561 --> 01:19:11,061
Yeah.

945
01:19:23,409 --> 01:19:26,810
- Louis Restaurant in the Bronx.
- Well is it reliable?

946
01:19:26,913 --> 01:19:28,724
That's my man in McCluskey's precinct.

947
01:19:28,748 --> 01:19:31,581
A police captain's got to be
on call 24 hours a day.

948
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:34,585
He signed out at that number
between 8:00 and 10:00.

949
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,231
Anybody know this joint?

950
01:19:36,255 --> 01:19:39,656
Yeah, sure. I do.
It's perfect for us.

951
01:19:39,759 --> 01:19:42,004
A small family place, good food.

952
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:44,861
Everyone minds his business.
It's perfect.

953
01:19:44,964 --> 01:19:47,762
Pete, they got
an old-fashioned toilet...

954
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:51,098
You know, the box
and the chain thing.

955
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,265
We might be able
to tape the gun behind it.

956
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:56,852
All right.

957
01:19:56,876 --> 01:20:00,039
Mike, you go to the restaurant.

958
01:20:00,146 --> 01:20:02,524
You eat, you talk for a while,
you relax.

959
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:04,226
You make them relax.

960
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,595
Then you get up
and go take a leak.

961
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:09,281
No, better still,
you ask for permission to go.

962
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,233
And when you come back,
you come out blasting.

963
01:20:11,257 --> 01:20:14,192
And don't take any chances.
Two shots in the head apiece.

964
01:20:14,293 --> 01:20:16,371
Now, listen.
I want somebody good...

965
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,373
and I mean very good...
to plant that gun.

966
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:22,077
I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet
with just his dick in his hands, all right?

967
01:20:22,101 --> 01:20:23,212
The gun will be there.

968
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:27,468
All right, listen. You drive him
and you pick him up after the job.

969
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:30,073
Come on. Let's move.

970
01:20:30,142 --> 01:20:32,642
Thank you, Tom.

971
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:37,815
Did he tell you
to drop the gun right away?

972
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,417
Yeah, a million times.

973
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,069
Now, you don't forget...
two shots apiece in the head...

974
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:49,238
as soon as you
come out the door.

975
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:51,762
Let's go.

976
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:57,998
How long do you think it'll be
before I can come back?

977
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:02,084
At least a year, Mike.

978
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:05,669
Listen, I'll square it with Mom, you know,
you not seeing her before you leave...

979
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:10,181
and I'll get a message
to that girlfriend...

980
01:21:10,283 --> 01:21:12,783
when I think the time is right.

981
01:21:17,957 --> 01:21:20,457
Take care.

982
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:25,128
- See you, Mike.
- Okay, Tom.

983
01:21:56,929 --> 01:21:58,907
I'm glad you came, Mike.

984
01:21:58,931 --> 01:22:01,431
I hope we can
straighten everything out.

985
01:22:02,101 --> 01:22:04,968
I mean, this is terrible. It's not the way
I wanted things to go at all.

986
01:22:05,071 --> 01:22:06,915
It should have never happened.

987
01:22:06,939 --> 01:22:09,084
I want to straighten
everything out tonight.

988
01:22:09,108 --> 01:22:11,586
I don't want my father
bothered anymore.

989
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:15,671
He won't be, Mike.
I swear on my children he won't be.

990
01:22:15,781 --> 01:22:19,012
But you got to keep an open mind
when we talk.

991
01:22:19,118 --> 01:22:21,596
I mean, I hope you're not a hot-head
like your brother Sonny.

992
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:24,120
You can't talk business
with him.

993
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:27,791
He's a good kid.

994
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:33,630
I'm sorry about
the other night, Mike.

995
01:22:34,734 --> 01:22:37,212
I gotta frisk you,
so turn around, huh?

996
01:22:37,236 --> 01:22:39,736
On your knees, facing me.

997
01:22:43,576 --> 01:22:46,477
I guess I'm getting
too old for my job.

998
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,624
Too grouchy.

999
01:22:49,648 --> 01:22:52,310
Can't stand the aggravation.

1000
01:22:52,418 --> 01:22:54,918
You know how it is.

1001
01:22:55,755 --> 01:22:58,255
He's clean.

1002
01:23:24,116 --> 01:23:26,616
We're going to Jersey?

1003
01:23:28,287 --> 01:23:30,787
Maybe.

1004
01:23:55,414 --> 01:23:57,914
Nice work, Lou.

1005
01:24:34,587 --> 01:24:36,631
How's the Italian food
in this restaurant?

1006
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,067
Good. Try the veal.

1007
01:24:39,091 --> 01:24:41,591
- It's the best in the city.
- I'll have it.

1008
01:24:43,092 --> 01:24:45,092
<i>Understand?</i>

1009
01:25:17,596 --> 01:25:19,441
I'm gonna speak Italian to Mike.

1010
01:25:19,465 --> 01:25:21,965
Go ahead.

1011
01:25:26,865 --> 01:25:29,365
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about it.

1012
01:25:32,366 --> 01:25:38,366
What happened to
your father was business.

1013
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:43,344
I have much respect for your father...

1014
01:25:43,368 --> 01:25:47,368
but your father's thinking
is old fashioned.

1015
01:25:48,369 --> 01:25:52,369
You must understand why
I did what I did.

1016
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:56,370
I understand these things.

1017
01:25:56,871 --> 01:25:58,548
I do.

1018
01:25:58,572 --> 01:26:01,072
You do.

1019
01:26:11,573 --> 01:26:15,573
Now we have to think about what happens

1020
01:26:15,874 --> 01:26:19,774
between you and the Tattaglias.

1021
01:26:20,574 --> 01:26:24,551
We have to work through

1022
01:26:24,575 --> 01:26:28,575
where we go from here.

1023
01:26:36,075 --> 01:26:38,575
How do I say...?

1024
01:26:40,379 --> 01:26:42,879
What I want...

1025
01:26:43,048 --> 01:26:45,548
what's most important to me...

1026
01:26:47,886 --> 01:26:50,031
is that I have a guarantee:

1027
01:26:50,055 --> 01:26:52,200
No more attempts
on my father's life.

1028
01:26:52,224 --> 01:26:56,456
What guarantees could I give you, Mike?
I am the hunted one.

1029
01:26:57,062 --> 01:27:00,122
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

1030
01:27:00,232 --> 01:27:02,732
I'm not that clever.

1031
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:06,402
All I want is a truce.

1032
01:27:12,911 --> 01:27:16,608
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is that all right?

1033
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:20,416
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1034
01:27:26,058 --> 01:27:27,669
I frisked him. He's clean.

1035
01:27:27,693 --> 01:27:30,193
Don't take too long.

1036
01:27:33,365 --> 01:27:35,865
I've frisked a thousand young punks.

1037
01:28:51,163 --> 01:28:53,663
Everything all right?

1038
01:28:54,664 --> 01:28:57,141
I respect myself... understand?

1039
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,165
And so I cannot allow your
father to hold me back.

1040
01:29:00,966 --> 01:29:03,966
What happened was unavoidable.

1041
01:29:04,967 --> 01:29:07,444
I had the unspoken support of
the other Dons.

1042
01:29:07,468 --> 01:29:09,945
If your father were in better health...

1043
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:12,469
without his eldest son running things...

1044
01:31:26,298 --> 01:31:27,775
Hey, come on.

1045
01:31:27,799 --> 01:31:30,299
Come on. Let's go.

1046
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:28,458
Joe, you take over.

1047
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,796
Hi, Grandpa.

1048
01:32:45,243 --> 01:32:47,743
I love you, Grandpa.

1049
01:32:49,748 --> 01:32:52,478
I'm sorry, Pa.
He doesn't know you yet.

1050
01:32:54,219 --> 01:32:57,065
- Here you are, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

1051
01:32:57,089 --> 01:32:59,233
"I hope you get red, Grandpa...

1052
01:32:59,257 --> 01:33:01,235
and I wish I would see you soon.

1053
01:33:01,259 --> 01:33:03,759
Love, your grandson, Frank."

1054
01:33:06,264 --> 01:33:08,576
Go with your mother.

1055
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,100
Go ahead. Take 'em downstairs.

1056
01:33:16,775 --> 01:33:19,275
Go on, Carlo. You too.

1057
01:33:20,612 --> 01:33:23,112
Go on.

1058
01:33:25,617 --> 01:33:28,848
I got chicken cacciatore
for you, sweetheart.

1059
01:33:28,954 --> 01:33:30,832
- That's enough bread.
- I like bread.

1060
01:33:30,856 --> 01:33:33,356
I know, but how much can you eat?

1061
01:33:42,901 --> 01:33:44,879
What's the matter with you, Carlo?

1062
01:33:44,903 --> 01:33:47,403
Shut up and set the table.

1063
01:34:02,587 --> 01:34:05,147
Since McCluskey's killing...

1064
01:34:05,257 --> 01:34:08,658
the police have been cracking down
most of our operations.

1065
01:34:10,429 --> 01:34:12,929
And also the other families'.

1066
01:34:13,432 --> 01:34:15,209
Been a lot of bad blood.

1067
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,725
They hit us, so we hit them back.

1068
01:34:19,604 --> 01:34:21,749
Through our contacts
in the newspapers...

1069
01:34:21,773 --> 01:34:24,085
we've been able to put out
a lot of material...

1070
01:34:24,109 --> 01:34:27,510
about McCluskey being linked
with Sollozzo in the drug rackets.

1071
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,280
See, things are
starting to loosen up.

1072
01:34:31,883 --> 01:34:36,616
Dad, I'm sending Fredo
to Las Vegas...

1073
01:34:36,722 --> 01:34:39,316
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

1074
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:41,369
I want him to rest.

1075
01:34:41,393 --> 01:34:43,871
I'm going to learn
the casino business.

1076
01:34:43,895 --> 01:34:46,395
Yeah.

1077
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:54,570
Where is Michael?

1078
01:35:06,418 --> 01:35:09,012
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

1079
01:35:11,423 --> 01:35:15,154
But he's safe. We're starting
to work to bring him back now.

1080
01:35:36,882 --> 01:35:39,482
I want you to find out where that
little pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

1081
01:35:39,506 --> 01:35:41,028
I want his ass now... right now.

1082
01:35:41,052 --> 01:35:42,864
- Hey, Sonny.
- What?

1083
01:35:42,888 --> 01:35:44,699
Things are starting to loosen up
a little bit.

1084
01:35:44,723 --> 01:35:47,453
If you go after Tattaglia,
all hell's going to break loose.

1085
01:35:47,559 --> 01:35:49,537
Let the smoke clear.
Pop can negotiate.

1086
01:35:49,561 --> 01:35:52,039
No, Pop can't do nothing till
he's better. I'm gonna decide what...

1087
01:35:52,063 --> 01:35:54,103
All right, but your war's
costing us a lot of money.

1088
01:35:54,127 --> 01:35:55,877
Nothing's coming in.
We can't do business.

1089
01:35:55,901 --> 01:35:58,631
Well neither can they.
Don't worry about it.

1090
01:35:58,737 --> 01:36:00,715
- We can't afford a stalemate.
- Well, then there ain't no more stalemate.

1091
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:02,717
I'm gonna end it
by killing that old bastard.

1092
01:36:02,741 --> 01:36:04,886
You're getting a great reputation.
I hope you're enjoying it.

1093
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:06,554
Well you just do what I tell you to do!

1094
01:36:06,578 --> 01:36:08,738
Goddamn it, if I had a wartime
consigliere, a Sicilian,

1095
01:36:08,762 --> 01:36:10,725
I wouldn't be in this shape!

1096
01:36:10,749 --> 01:36:13,249
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

1097
01:36:16,588 --> 01:36:19,088
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

1098
01:36:20,091 --> 01:36:23,117
Mom made a little dinner.
It's Sunday.

1099
01:36:24,095 --> 01:36:26,825
Them niggers are having
a good time...

1100
01:36:26,932 --> 01:36:28,576
with our policy banks
up there in Harlem.

1101
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:32,434
Driving them new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

1102
01:36:32,537 --> 01:36:35,938
I knew that was gonna happen as soon
as they started making big money.

1103
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:39,602
Look, Papa never talked business
at the table in front of the kids.

1104
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:42,441
- Hey, shut up, Connie.
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

1105
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:45,607
- You got that?
- Santino, don't interfere.

1106
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:50,152
You know, Sonny, Tom, I'd like to talk
to you, maybe after dinner.

1107
01:36:50,222 --> 01:36:52,200
I could be doing a lot more
for the family.

1108
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,724
We don't discuss business
at the table.

1109
01:37:41,709 --> 01:37:44,339
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

1110
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:49,146
Michael

1111
01:37:49,879 --> 01:37:51,889
Why are you so far
from the house?

1112
01:37:52,549 --> 01:37:55,219
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

1113
01:37:55,309 --> 01:37:56,599
The bodyguards are here.

1114
01:37:57,519 --> 01:37:58,849
It's still dangerous...

1115
01:37:59,979 --> 01:38:01,729
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

1116
01:38:03,149 --> 01:38:05,399
Your enemies know you're here.

1117
01:38:07,399 --> 01:38:09,149
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

1118
01:38:09,819 --> 01:38:11,109
Not yet.

1119
01:38:11,779 --> 01:38:13,619
It's out of the question.

1120
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:18,499
Where are you going now?

1121
01:38:19,135 --> 01:38:20,135
Corleone.

1122
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:21,209
To Corleone.

1123
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:23,079
Take my car.

1124
01:38:26,419 --> 01:38:27,459
I want to walk.

1125
01:38:30,089 --> 01:38:31,259
Be careful.

1126
01:38:51,648 --> 01:38:53,648
Look there. Corleone.

1127
01:39:05,789 --> 01:39:07,169
Where have all the men gone?

1128
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:10,419
They're all dead from vendettas.

1129
01:39:12,049 --> 01:39:14,469
There are the names of the dead.

1130
01:39:30,985 --> 01:39:34,318
Hey, American!
Take me to the America! G.I.!

1131
01:39:34,885 --> 01:39:35,885
Hey, hey, hey!

1132
01:39:35,924 --> 01:39:38,984
Take me to America, G.I.
Clark Gable.

1133
01:39:39,485 --> 01:39:40,962
America! America!

1134
01:39:40,986 --> 01:39:42,463
Take me to the America, G.I.

1135
01:39:42,487 --> 01:39:44,487
Clark Gable. Rita Hayworth.

1136
01:40:02,679 --> 01:40:04,729
Mamma mia what a beauty.

1137
01:40:12,899 --> 01:40:15,989
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

1138
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:26,209
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

1139
01:40:37,805 --> 01:40:39,805
Hey, host.

1140
01:40:41,506 --> 01:40:43,506
A bottle of wine.

1141
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:51,059
Did you have a good hunt?

1142
01:40:52,019 --> 01:40:54,399
You know all the girls
around here?

1143
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:56,399
We saw some real beauties.

1144
01:40:57,239 --> 01:41:00,739
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

1145
01:41:03,949 --> 01:41:06,709
She would tempt the devil himself.

1146
01:41:14,339 --> 01:41:16,509
Really put together.

1147
01:41:16,589 --> 01:41:17,629
Right, Calo?

1148
01:41:21,389 --> 01:41:23,389
Such hair, such mouth!

1149
01:41:25,769 --> 01:41:28,939
The girls around here are
beautiful... but virtuous.

1150
01:41:29,479 --> 01:41:31,859
This one had a purple dress...

1151
01:41:32,229 --> 01:41:34,359
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

1152
01:41:35,229 --> 01:41:38,399
A type more Greek than Italian.

1153
01:41:40,819 --> 01:41:42,659
Do you know her?

1154
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:49,869
There's no girl like that
in this town.

1155
01:41:52,579 --> 01:41:53,789
My God, I understand!

1156
01:41:57,919 --> 01:41:58,919
What's wrong?

1157
01:42:01,129 --> 01:42:02,509
Let's go.

1158
01:42:04,469 --> 01:42:05,719
It's his daughter.

1159
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:07,679
Tell him to come here.

1160
01:42:11,099 --> 01:42:12,439
Call him.

1161
01:42:32,499 --> 01:42:34,829
Fabrizio, you translate.

1162
01:42:38,806 --> 01:42:41,306
I apologize if I offended you.

1163
01:42:42,143 --> 01:42:44,643
I'm a stranger in this country...

1164
01:42:45,146 --> 01:42:48,047
and I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

1165
01:42:53,821 --> 01:42:56,321
I'm an American hiding in Sicily.

1166
01:42:57,992 --> 01:43:00,492
My name is Michael Corleone.

1167
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:04,971
There are people who would pay
a lot of money for that information.

1168
01:43:08,836 --> 01:43:11,336
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

1169
01:43:13,274 --> 01:43:15,774
instead of gaining a husband.

1170
01:43:23,518 --> 01:43:26,018
I want to meet your daughter...

1171
01:43:26,854 --> 01:43:28,665
with your permission...

1172
01:43:28,689 --> 01:43:31,189
and under the supervision
of your family...

1173
01:43:32,126 --> 01:43:34,626
with all respect.

1174
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:43,899
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

1175
01:43:49,409 --> 01:43:50,909
What's her name?

1176
01:43:52,313 --> 01:43:54,813
Apollonia.

1177
01:44:49,314 --> 01:44:52,291
...this is my daughter, Apollonia...

1178
01:44:52,315 --> 01:44:55,315
and this is Michael Corleone.

1179
01:45:11,316 --> 01:45:13,316
Thank you.

1180
01:45:13,917 --> 01:45:15,917
Your welcome.

1181
01:45:25,918 --> 01:45:28,418
What's the problem with your eye.

1182
01:45:28,919 --> 01:45:31,419
No, no. It's nothing. It's fine.

1183
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:48,620
Hey! I'm gonna knock you dizzy.

1184
01:46:54,128 --> 01:46:56,628
Save it for the library.

1185
01:46:59,767 --> 01:47:02,267
Come on. We gotta go
pick up my sister. Let's go.

1186
01:47:20,488 --> 01:47:22,988
What's the matter?

1187
01:47:24,789 --> 01:47:26,789
What's the matter?

1188
01:47:27,995 --> 01:47:30,140
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

1189
01:47:30,164 --> 01:47:33,565
Sonny, please. It was my fault.
Sonny, it was my fault. I hit him.

1190
01:47:33,668 --> 01:47:35,579
I started a fight with him.
Please, Sonny.

1191
01:47:35,603 --> 01:47:38,103
I'm sorry.

1192
01:47:42,077 --> 01:47:45,407
Okay, I'm just... I'm just gonna get a
doctor to come and take a look at you.

1193
01:47:45,613 --> 01:47:48,343
Sonny, please don't do anything.
Please, don't do it.

1194
01:47:50,451 --> 01:47:52,596
What's the matter with you?
What am I gonna do?

1195
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:55,418
Am I gonna make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

1196
01:47:58,292 --> 01:47:59,770
All right?

1197
01:47:59,794 --> 01:48:02,888
Still betting the Yankees
pretty heavy?

1198
01:48:02,997 --> 01:48:05,497
Tell him to stop
taking action, all right?

1199
01:48:06,667 --> 01:48:09,167
You lost enough money
last weekend to me.

1200
01:48:15,042 --> 01:48:17,542
Carlo, come here.

1201
01:49:14,635 --> 01:49:17,365
You touch my sister again,
I'll kill you.

1202
01:53:12,706 --> 01:53:15,436
Weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

1203
01:53:15,542 --> 01:53:19,842
Yes, well, I have.
I mean I've tried writing and calling.

1204
01:53:19,947 --> 01:53:22,292
Now, I wanna reach Michael.

1205
01:53:22,316 --> 01:53:25,717
Nobody knows where he is. We know
that he's all right, but that's all.

1206
01:53:28,989 --> 01:53:30,967
- What was that?
- That's an accident.

1207
01:53:30,991 --> 01:53:33,687
But nobody was hurt.

1208
01:53:33,761 --> 01:53:34,761
Tom...

1209
01:53:35,262 --> 01:53:39,096
Would you give this letter
to Michael, please? Please?

1210
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:41,511
Well, if I accepted that...

1211
01:53:41,535 --> 01:53:45,096
in a court of law they could prove that
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

1212
01:53:45,205 --> 01:53:47,925
Now you just be patient, Kay.
He'll get in touch with you, all right?

1213
01:53:47,949 --> 01:53:51,310
I let my cab go, so can I come in
to call another one, please?

1214
01:53:51,412 --> 01:53:53,912
Come on. I'm sorry. Come on.

1215
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:12,730
Hello?

1216
01:54:14,301 --> 01:54:16,046
<i>Is Carlo there?</i>

1217
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:18,515
<i>- Who's this?
- This is a friend of Carlo's.</i>

1218
01:54:18,539 --> 01:54:21,599
<i>Would you tell him that
I can't make it tonight until later?</i>

1219
01:54:27,815 --> 01:54:30,315
Bitch.

1220
01:54:31,085 --> 01:54:33,679
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry yet.

1221
01:54:33,787 --> 01:54:35,765
Your food is on the table.
It's getting cold.

1222
01:54:35,789 --> 01:54:38,849
- I'll eat out later.
- You just told me to make you dinner.

1223
01:54:38,959 --> 01:54:40,937
Hey, fuck you, eh?

1224
01:54:40,961 --> 01:54:43,461
Go fuck yourself!

1225
01:54:48,168 --> 01:54:50,668
This little guinea brat.

1226
01:54:55,075 --> 01:54:57,669
That's it. Break it all,
you spoiled guinea brat.

1227
01:54:57,778 --> 01:55:00,278
Break it all!

1228
01:55:02,983 --> 01:55:05,483
That's it. Break it all.

1229
01:55:08,589 --> 01:55:12,787
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

1230
01:55:12,893 --> 01:55:15,393
Maybe I will. Why not?

1231
01:55:21,068 --> 01:55:23,513
- Now clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

1232
01:55:23,537 --> 01:55:26,015
Clean it up,
you guinea spoiled brat!

1233
01:55:26,039 --> 01:55:28,539
Clean it up! Clean it up!

1234
01:55:32,946 --> 01:55:35,446
You son of a bitch!

1235
01:55:44,124 --> 01:55:47,218
Come on, now! Kill me!
Be a murderer like your father!

1236
01:55:47,327 --> 01:55:49,639
- Come on! All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

1237
01:55:49,663 --> 01:55:51,374
- Come on!
- I'll kill you!

1238
01:55:51,398 --> 01:55:53,877
Kill me! Get up!

1239
01:55:53,901 --> 01:55:55,512
Get out of here!

1240
01:55:55,536 --> 01:55:59,028
- I hate you!
- Now go ahead. Now I'll kill you.

1241
01:55:59,139 --> 01:56:01,117
You guinea brat, you.

1242
01:56:01,141 --> 01:56:03,641
Get out here!

1243
01:56:12,486 --> 01:56:15,421
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you. What is it?

1244
01:56:16,590 --> 01:56:19,457
Honey, talk louder.
The baby's crying.

1245
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:21,571
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

1246
01:56:21,595 --> 01:56:23,640
I don't understand.

1247
01:56:23,664 --> 01:56:26,164
Yeah, Connie.

1248
01:56:30,704 --> 01:56:33,204
Listen, you wait there.

1249
01:56:35,075 --> 01:56:37,575
No, you just wait there.

1250
01:56:39,379 --> 01:56:42,280
- That son of a bitch.
- Sonny, what's the matter?

1251
01:56:42,382 --> 01:56:44,494
- Son of a bitch!
- What's the matter?

1252
01:56:44,518 --> 01:56:47,018
Damn it!

1253
01:56:49,189 --> 01:56:51,817
Open the goddamn gate.
Get off your ass.

1254
01:57:08,342 --> 01:57:11,175
- Sonny, come on!
- Get out of here!

1255
01:57:11,278 --> 01:57:13,778
Go after him. Go on.

1256
01:57:42,175 --> 01:57:44,087
Son of a bitch.

1257
01:57:44,111 --> 01:57:46,611
Come on! Come on!

1258
01:59:33,687 --> 01:59:36,187
Give me a drop.

1259
01:59:43,797 --> 01:59:46,297
My wife is crying upstairs.

1260
01:59:48,468 --> 01:59:50,968
I hear cars coming to the house.

1261
01:59:55,542 --> 01:59:58,042
Consigliere of mine...

1262
01:59:58,912 --> 02:00:01,847
I think you should tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

1263
02:00:01,948 --> 02:00:04,448
Well, I didn't tell Mama anything.

1264
02:00:05,652 --> 02:00:09,179
I was about to come up and wake you
just now and tell you.

1265
02:00:12,325 --> 02:00:14,825
But you needed a drink first.

1266
02:00:21,401 --> 02:00:23,901
Now you've had your drink.

1267
02:00:29,443 --> 02:00:33,607
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

1268
02:00:50,897 --> 02:00:53,397
I want all inquiries made.

1269
02:00:57,571 --> 02:01:00,071
I want no acts of vengeance.

1270
02:01:01,608 --> 02:01:04,108
I want you to arrange a meeting...

1271
02:01:05,412 --> 02:01:07,912
with the heads
of the five families.

1272
02:01:10,150 --> 02:01:12,650
This war stops now.

1273
02:01:34,107 --> 02:01:36,632
Call Bonasera.

1274
02:01:36,743 --> 02:01:39,243
We need him now.

1275
02:01:51,091 --> 02:01:54,060
This is Tom Hagen
calling for Vito Corleone...

1276
02:01:54,161 --> 02:01:56,239
at his request.

1277
02:01:56,263 --> 02:01:58,541
Now, you owe your Don a service.

1278
02:01:58,565 --> 02:02:02,399
<i>He has no doubt that
you will repay it.</i>

1279
02:02:02,502 --> 02:02:05,266
<i>Now, he will be at your
funeral parlor in one hour.</i>

1280
02:02:05,372 --> 02:02:07,872
<i>Be there to greet him.</i>

1281
02:02:28,094 --> 02:02:30,406
Well, my friend...

1282
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:32,875
are you ready
to do me this service?

1283
02:02:32,899 --> 02:02:34,544
Yes.

1284
02:02:34,568 --> 02:02:37,093
What do you want me to do?

1285
02:02:44,444 --> 02:02:47,470
I want you to use
all your powers...

1286
02:02:47,581 --> 02:02:50,081
and all your skills.

1287
02:02:53,086 --> 02:02:55,586
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

1288
02:03:12,138 --> 02:03:14,638
Look how they massacred my boy.

1289
02:03:44,099 --> 02:03:47,359
It's safer to teach you English!

1290
02:03:48,109 --> 02:03:49,485
I know English...

1291
02:03:49,509 --> 02:03:51,387
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday...

1292
02:03:51,411 --> 02:03:54,039
Wednesday, Friday,
Sunday, Saturday.

1293
02:04:01,619 --> 02:04:03,409
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

1294
02:04:04,119 --> 02:04:06,119
How are things in Palermo?

1295
02:04:12,129 --> 02:04:16,179
Michael is teaching me to
drive... watch, I'll show you.

1296
02:04:18,969 --> 02:04:20,809
How are things in Palermo?

1297
02:04:21,179 --> 02:04:24,309
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

1298
02:04:25,389 --> 02:04:28,769
times are changing for the worse.

1299
02:04:31,019 --> 02:04:34,439
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

1300
02:04:37,159 --> 02:04:42,329
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa... right now.

1301
02:04:48,329 --> 02:04:49,499
What's wrong?

1302
02:04:50,629 --> 02:04:52,839
Bad news from America.

1303
02:04:55,299 --> 02:04:59,009
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

1304
02:05:05,599 --> 02:05:07,439
Let's go... you promised.

1305
02:05:26,226 --> 02:05:27,226
Fabrizio!

1306
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:27,305
- Fabrizio.
- Yes, sir?

1307
02:05:27,329 --> 02:05:28,749
Get the car.

1308
02:05:30,076 --> 02:05:31,721
Are you driving yourself, boss?

1309
02:05:31,745 --> 02:05:34,023
- Yes.
- Is your wife coming with you?

1310
02:05:34,047 --> 02:05:37,608
No. I want you to take her to her father's
house till I know things are safe.

1311
02:05:37,717 --> 02:05:40,217
Okay. Anything you say, boss.

1312
02:05:45,889 --> 02:05:47,639
Calo, where is Apollonia?

1313
02:05:48,389 --> 02:05:51,899
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

1314
02:05:54,189 --> 02:05:56,229
She'll make a good American wife.

1315
02:05:57,689 --> 02:06:00,239
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

1316
02:06:10,499 --> 02:06:12,669
Fabrizio!

1317
02:06:12,749 --> 02:06:14,419
Where are you going?

1318
02:06:16,129 --> 02:06:18,549
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

1319
02:06:49,255 --> 02:06:51,167
Don Barzini,
I want to thank you...

1320
02:06:51,191 --> 02:06:54,718
for helping me organize
this meeting here today.

1321
02:06:54,828 --> 02:06:58,195
And also the other heads
of the five families...

1322
02:06:58,298 --> 02:07:00,798
from New York and New Jersey.

1323
02:07:01,801 --> 02:07:04,827
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx.

1324
02:07:07,307 --> 02:07:09,807
From Brooklyn...

1325
02:07:09,976 --> 02:07:12,476
Philip Tattaglia.

1326
02:07:13,880 --> 02:07:16,713
And from Staten Island...

1327
02:07:16,816 --> 02:07:20,081
we have with us Victor Strachi.

1328
02:07:20,186 --> 02:07:22,686
And all the other associates
that came as far...

1329
02:07:22,755 --> 02:07:25,883
as from California
and Kansas City...

1330
02:07:25,992 --> 02:07:28,404
and all the other territories
of the country.

1331
02:07:28,428 --> 02:07:30,928
Thank you.

1332
02:07:36,536 --> 02:07:39,036
How did things ever get so far?

1333
02:07:40,073 --> 02:07:42,573
I don't know.

1334
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:47,302
It was so unfortunate
and so unnecessary.

1335
02:07:50,383 --> 02:07:52,595
Tattaglia lost a son...

1336
02:07:52,619 --> 02:07:55,119
and I lost a son.

1337
02:07:55,855 --> 02:07:59,450
We're quits,
and if Tattaglia agrees...

1338
02:07:59,559 --> 02:08:03,620
then I'm willing to let things
go on the way they were before.

1339
02:08:05,265 --> 02:08:08,792
We are all grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

1340
02:08:08,902 --> 02:08:11,598
We all know him
as a man of his word.

1341
02:08:11,704 --> 02:08:13,916
A modest man.
He'll always listen to reason.

1342
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:16,440
Yes, Don Barzini.

1343
02:08:16,476 --> 02:08:18,521
He's too modest.

1344
02:08:18,545 --> 02:08:21,514
He had all the judges
and politicians in his pocket.

1345
02:08:22,916 --> 02:08:25,749
He refused to share them.

1346
02:08:25,852 --> 02:08:28,844
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

1347
02:08:29,722 --> 02:08:32,222
All of you know me here.

1348
02:08:33,092 --> 02:08:37,119
When did I ever refuse,
except one time?

1349
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:39,730
And why?

1350
02:08:39,899 --> 02:08:42,399
Because I believe
this drug business...

1351
02:08:42,502 --> 02:08:45,630
is going to destroy us
in the years to come.

1352
02:08:45,738 --> 02:08:49,469
I mean, it's not like gambling
or liquor or even women...

1353
02:08:49,576 --> 02:08:52,306
which is something that
most people want nowadays...

1354
02:08:52,412 --> 02:08:55,870
and is forbidden to them by
the pezzonovante of the church.

1355
02:08:55,982 --> 02:08:59,076
Even the police departments
that have helped us in the past...

1356
02:08:59,185 --> 02:09:00,996
with gambling and other things...

1357
02:09:01,020 --> 02:09:05,150
are gonna refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

1358
02:09:05,258 --> 02:09:08,193
And I believed that then...

1359
02:09:08,294 --> 02:09:10,406
and I believe that now.

1360
02:09:10,430 --> 02:09:12,708
Times have changed.

1361
02:09:12,732 --> 02:09:14,977
It's not like the old days...

1362
02:09:15,001 --> 02:09:17,501
when we could do
anything we want.

1363
02:09:17,537 --> 02:09:20,438
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

1364
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:24,476
If Don Corleone had all the judges
and the politicians in New York...

1365
02:09:24,577 --> 02:09:27,569
then he must share them
or let others use them.

1366
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:30,843
He must let us draw
the water from the well.

1367
02:09:31,784 --> 02:09:35,345
Certainly, he can present a bill
for such services.

1368
02:09:35,455 --> 02:09:38,185
After all, we are not Communists.

1369
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:44,220
I also don't believe in drugs.

1370
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:46,542
For years,
I paid my people extra...

1371
02:09:46,566 --> 02:09:48,944
so they wouldn't do
that kind of business.

1372
02:09:48,968 --> 02:09:52,404
Somebody comes to them and says,
"I have powders.

1373
02:09:52,505 --> 02:09:55,235
If you put up a three, four
thousand dollar investment,

1374
02:09:56,209 --> 02:09:58,871
we can make 50,000 distributing."

1375
02:09:59,979 --> 02:10:03,779
So they can't resist. I want
to control it as a business...

1376
02:10:03,883 --> 02:10:06,328
to keep it respectable.

1377
02:10:06,352 --> 02:10:10,880
I don't want it near schools.
I don't want it sold to children.

1378
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:13,490
That's an infamia.

1379
02:10:14,027 --> 02:10:17,963
In my city, we would keep the traffic
in the dark people, the colored.

1380
02:10:18,064 --> 02:10:20,931
They're animals anyway,
so let them lose their souls.

1381
02:10:27,907 --> 02:10:31,206
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

1382
02:10:32,945 --> 02:10:36,108
And as a reasonable man, I'm willing
to do whatever's necessary...

1383
02:10:36,215 --> 02:10:39,707
to find a peaceful solution
to these problems.

1384
02:10:39,819 --> 02:10:41,964
Then we are agreed.

1385
02:10:41,988 --> 02:10:44,400
The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

1386
02:10:44,424 --> 02:10:46,984
And Don Corleone will give our
protection in the east...

1387
02:10:47,093 --> 02:10:49,004
and there will be the peace.

1388
02:10:49,028 --> 02:10:52,896
But I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

1389
02:10:52,999 --> 02:10:56,162
As time goes by and
his position becomes stronger...

1390
02:10:56,269 --> 02:10:58,794
will he attempt
any individual vendetta?

1391
02:10:58,905 --> 02:11:00,949
Look, we are all
reasonable men here.

1392
02:11:00,973 --> 02:11:04,409
We don't have to give assurances
as if we were lawyers.

1393
02:11:04,510 --> 02:11:06,722
You talk about vengeance.

1394
02:11:06,746 --> 02:11:10,011
Is vengeance gonna bring
your son back to you?

1395
02:11:10,116 --> 02:11:12,616
Or my boy to me?

1396
02:11:13,286 --> 02:11:15,786
I forego the vengeance of my son.

1397
02:11:18,925 --> 02:11:21,425
But I have selfish reasons.

1398
02:11:23,429 --> 02:11:25,441
My youngest son...

1399
02:11:25,465 --> 02:11:27,965
was forced to leave this country...

1400
02:11:28,968 --> 02:11:31,468
because of this Sollozzo business.

1401
02:11:31,938 --> 02:11:34,771
All right.
And I have to make arrangements...

1402
02:11:34,874 --> 02:11:39,504
to bring him back here safely,
cleared of all these false charges.

1403
02:11:41,147 --> 02:11:44,173
But I'm a superstitious man.

1404
02:11:44,283 --> 02:11:46,843
And if some unlucky accident
should befall him...

1405
02:11:46,953 --> 02:11:50,684
if he should get shot
in the head by a police officer...

1406
02:11:50,790 --> 02:11:54,624
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell...

1407
02:11:54,727 --> 02:11:57,227
of if he's struck
by a bolt of lightening...

1408
02:11:58,865 --> 02:12:01,891
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

1409
02:12:04,103 --> 02:12:06,603
And that I do not forgive.

1410
02:12:08,941 --> 02:12:11,441
But that aside...

1411
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:16,880
let me say that I swear...

1412
02:12:18,317 --> 02:12:21,411
on the souls of my grandchildren...

1413
02:12:21,521 --> 02:12:25,048
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

1414
02:12:51,450 --> 02:12:53,690
When I meet with the Tattaglia
people, should I insist...

1415
02:12:53,714 --> 02:12:56,819
that all these drug middlemen
have clean records?

1416
02:12:56,923 --> 02:12:59,423
Mention it. Don't insist.

1417
02:13:01,260 --> 02:13:03,760
Barzini is a man who'll know that
without being told.

1418
02:13:05,097 --> 02:13:07,691
You mean Tattaglia.

1419
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:10,530
Tattaglia's a pimp.

1420
02:13:10,636 --> 02:13:13,136
He never could've outfought Santino.

1421
02:13:16,475 --> 02:13:20,138
But I didn't know until this day
that it was...

1422
02:13:20,246 --> 02:13:22,746
Barzini all along.

1423
02:13:37,396 --> 02:13:39,896
Come on, Nancy.

1424
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:43,100
Keep together, everyone. Brian?

1425
02:13:44,470 --> 02:13:46,970
Okay. All right.

1426
02:13:59,518 --> 02:14:02,043
How long have you been back?

1427
02:14:02,154 --> 02:14:04,654
I've been back a year.

1428
02:14:05,591 --> 02:14:08,116
Longer than that, I think.

1429
02:14:10,363 --> 02:14:12,863
It's good to see you, Kay.

1430
02:14:18,771 --> 02:14:21,271
Hi, Miss Adams!

1431
02:14:23,609 --> 02:14:26,109
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1432
02:14:28,748 --> 02:14:30,759
He's been sick.

1433
02:14:30,783 --> 02:14:33,195
Very sick.

1434
02:14:33,219 --> 02:14:35,297
But you're not like him, Michael.

1435
02:14:35,321 --> 02:14:37,846
I thought you weren't going
to become a man like your father.

1436
02:14:37,957 --> 02:14:40,457
That's what you told me.

1437
02:14:40,993 --> 02:14:43,723
My father's no different
than any other powerful man.

1438
02:14:45,398 --> 02:14:48,959
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1439
02:14:50,069 --> 02:14:52,547
Like a senator or a president.

1440
02:14:52,571 --> 02:14:55,096
- Do you know how naive you sound?
- Why?

1441
02:14:55,207 --> 02:14:57,801
Senators and presidents
don't have men killed.

1442
02:14:59,146 --> 02:15:00,146
Oh.

1443
02:15:01,147 --> 02:15:03,647
Who's being naive, Kay?

1444
02:15:04,283 --> 02:15:06,495
Kay, my father's way
of doing things is over.

1445
02:15:06,519 --> 02:15:10,011
It's finished.
Even he knows that.

1446
02:15:10,122 --> 02:15:12,134
I mean, in five years
the Corleone family...

1447
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:14,658
is going to be completely legitimate.

1448
02:15:16,429 --> 02:15:19,273
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business.

1449
02:15:19,297 --> 02:15:20,297
Kay.

1450
02:15:21,767 --> 02:15:24,112
Michael, why did you come here?

1451
02:15:24,136 --> 02:15:26,315
Why?

1452
02:15:26,339 --> 02:15:28,383
What do you want with me
after all this time...

1453
02:15:28,407 --> 02:15:30,932
without even calling or writing?

1454
02:15:31,043 --> 02:15:33,021
I came here because I need you.

1455
02:15:33,045 --> 02:15:35,570
- Because I care for you.
- Please stop it, Michael.

1456
02:15:35,681 --> 02:15:38,809
Because I want you to marry me.

1457
02:15:40,319 --> 02:15:42,819
- It's too late. It's too late.
- Please. Kay.

1458
02:15:44,523 --> 02:15:48,391
I'll do anything you ask, anything to
make up for what's happened to us.

1459
02:15:50,196 --> 02:15:52,507
Because that's important, Kay.

1460
02:15:52,531 --> 02:15:56,023
Because what's important is that...

1461
02:15:56,135 --> 02:15:57,946
we have each other.

1462
02:15:57,970 --> 02:16:00,871
That we have a life together.

1463
02:16:00,973 --> 02:16:04,431
That we have children.
Our children.

1464
02:16:04,932 --> 02:16:05,932
Kay...

1465
02:16:06,579 --> 02:16:09,309
I need you...

1466
02:16:09,415 --> 02:16:11,915
and I love you.

1467
02:16:33,039 --> 02:16:35,017
Barzini's people
chisel my territory...

1468
02:16:35,041 --> 02:16:36,885
and we do nothing about it.

1469
02:16:36,909 --> 02:16:39,590
Pretty soon, there won't be one place
in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

1470
02:16:39,645 --> 02:16:42,170
- Just be patient.
- I'm not askin' you for help, Mike.

1471
02:16:42,281 --> 02:16:44,806
- Just take off the handcuffs.
- Be patient.

1472
02:16:44,917 --> 02:16:47,029
We gotta protect ourselves.

1473
02:16:47,053 --> 02:16:49,031
Give me a chance to recruit
some new men.

1474
02:16:49,055 --> 02:16:50,665
No.

1475
02:16:50,689 --> 02:16:53,189
I don't wanna give Barzini
an excuse to start fighting.

1476
02:16:53,259 --> 02:16:55,784
Mike, you're wrong.

1477
02:16:55,895 --> 02:16:59,524
Don Corleone, you once said
that the day would come...

1478
02:16:59,632 --> 02:17:02,328
when Tessio and me
could form our own family.

1479
02:17:02,435 --> 02:17:04,413
Till today,
I would never think of it.

1480
02:17:04,437 --> 02:17:06,782
I must ask your permission.

1481
02:17:06,806 --> 02:17:10,037
Well, Michael is now
head of the family...

1482
02:17:10,142 --> 02:17:12,838
and if he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1483
02:17:14,413 --> 02:17:16,913
After we make the move to Nevada...

1484
02:17:17,016 --> 02:17:20,008
you can break off from the Corleone
family and go on your own.

1485
02:17:20,119 --> 02:17:22,917
- After we make the move to Nevada.
- How long will that be?

1486
02:17:24,156 --> 02:17:25,767
Six months.

1487
02:17:25,791 --> 02:17:29,249
Forgive me, Godfather,
but with you gone...

1488
02:17:29,361 --> 02:17:32,330
me and Pete'll come under
Barzini's thumb sooner or later.

1489
02:17:32,431 --> 02:17:34,931
And I hate that goddamn Barzini.

1490
02:17:34,967 --> 02:17:37,902
In six months' time, there won't be
nothing left to build on.

1491
02:17:38,003 --> 02:17:40,995
- You have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1492
02:17:41,107 --> 02:17:43,905
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Yes, always, Godfather.

1493
02:17:44,009 --> 02:17:46,254
Then be a friend to Michael...

1494
02:17:46,278 --> 02:17:48,778
and do as he says.

1495
02:17:52,218 --> 02:17:54,738
There are things being negotiated
now that are going to solve...

1496
02:17:54,762 --> 02:17:57,514
all your problems
and answer all your questions.

1497
02:17:57,623 --> 02:18:00,123
That's all I can tell you now.

1498
02:18:00,626 --> 02:18:03,254
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1499
02:18:03,362 --> 02:18:06,525
When we make our move there,
you're gonna be my right-hand man.

1500
02:18:06,632 --> 02:18:09,328
Tom Hagen's no longer consigliere.

1501
02:18:09,435 --> 02:18:11,913
He's gonna be our lawyer in Vegas.

1502
02:18:11,937 --> 02:18:14,382
That's no reflection on Tom,
but that's the way I want it.

1503
02:18:14,406 --> 02:18:16,318
Besides, if I ever need help...

1504
02:18:16,342 --> 02:18:18,620
who's a better consigliere
than my father?

1505
02:18:18,644 --> 02:18:21,144
Now that's it.

1506
02:18:39,231 --> 02:18:41,731
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1507
02:18:43,137 --> 02:18:47,367
Mike, ehh... Why am I out?

1508
02:18:47,473 --> 02:18:49,973
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1509
02:18:51,544 --> 02:18:54,044
Things may get rough
with the move we're trying.

1510
02:18:54,745 --> 02:18:55,745
Tom...

1511
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:03,565
I advised Michael.

1512
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:06,490
I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1513
02:19:06,592 --> 02:19:09,857
I thought Santino was a bad Don...

1514
02:19:09,962 --> 02:19:12,207
rest in peace.

1515
02:19:12,231 --> 02:19:15,257
Michael has all my confidence,
as, as you do.

1516
02:19:16,468 --> 02:19:19,995
But there are reasons why
you must have no part...

1517
02:19:20,105 --> 02:19:22,317
in what is going to happen.

1518
02:19:22,341 --> 02:19:23,818
Maybe I could help.

1519
02:19:23,842 --> 02:19:26,342
You're out, Tom.

1520
02:20:14,760 --> 02:20:17,285
I can't get over the way
your face looks.

1521
02:20:17,396 --> 02:20:20,559
It really looks good.
This doctor did some job.

1522
02:20:20,666 --> 02:20:23,294
Who talked you into it, Kay?
Hey, hey, wait.

1523
02:20:23,402 --> 02:20:25,780
Leave them out here.
We'll deal with them later.

1524
02:20:25,804 --> 02:20:27,782
He's tired.
He wants to clean up.

1525
02:20:27,806 --> 02:20:30,866
For right now, let me open the door.
All right?

1526
02:20:36,415 --> 02:20:38,727
Hello, Mike.
Welcome to Las Vegas.

1527
02:20:38,751 --> 02:20:42,016
All for you, kid.
It was all his idea, right?

1528
02:20:42,121 --> 02:20:44,919
- Well, your brother, Freddy...
- It was... Girls?

1529
02:20:48,661 --> 02:20:51,459
I'll be right back.
You keep them occupied.

1530
02:20:51,563 --> 02:20:54,498
That a boy.
Anything you want, kid, anything. Huh?

1531
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:57,100
Who are the girls?

1532
02:20:57,670 --> 02:20:59,648
That's for you to find out.

1533
02:20:59,672 --> 02:21:02,539
Get rid of them, Fredo.

1534
02:21:02,641 --> 02:21:04,753
- Hey, Mike...
- Fredo, I'm here on business.

1535
02:21:04,777 --> 02:21:08,508
I leave tomorrow.
Now, get rid of them. I'm tired.

1536
02:21:08,614 --> 02:21:11,114
Get rid of the band too.

1537
02:21:16,088 --> 02:21:18,886
Hey, just take off.
Come on. Let's go.

1538
02:21:18,991 --> 02:21:22,256
Hey, that's it.
Hey, Angelo, that's it.

1539
02:21:22,361 --> 02:21:24,372
Let's go. Hey, come on!

1540
02:21:24,396 --> 02:21:26,896
Scram!

1541
02:21:27,166 --> 02:21:29,511
Come on, honey. Let's go.
I don't know, Johnny.

1542
02:21:29,535 --> 02:21:31,895
I don't know what the hell's
the matter with him. I'm sorry.

1543
02:21:31,919 --> 02:21:33,982
It's all right, Freddy.

1544
02:21:34,006 --> 02:21:36,506
I don't know.
He's tired, he's hot.

1545
02:21:43,515 --> 02:21:46,015
What happened to Moe Greene?

1546
02:21:46,618 --> 02:21:49,097
He said he had some business.
He said give him a call...

1547
02:21:49,121 --> 02:21:51,066
when the party started.

1548
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:53,590
Well, give him a call.

1549
02:21:54,393 --> 02:21:57,487
- Johnny, how are you?
- Hello, Mike. Nice to see you again.

1550
02:21:57,596 --> 02:21:59,741
- We're all proud of you.
- Thanks, Mike.

1551
02:21:59,765 --> 02:22:02,143
Sit down, Johnny.
I want to talk to you.

1552
02:22:02,167 --> 02:22:06,604
- The Don's proud of you, too, Johnny.
- Well, I, owe it all to him.

1553
02:22:06,705 --> 02:22:08,717
Well, he knows
how grateful you are.

1554
02:22:08,741 --> 02:22:11,801
That's why he'd like to ask
a favor of you.

1555
02:22:11,910 --> 02:22:14,410
Mike, what can I do?

1556
02:22:15,199 --> 02:22:17,759
The Corleone family is thinking
of giving up all its interests...

1557
02:22:17,783 --> 02:22:21,184
in the olive oil business,
settling out here.

1558
02:22:21,286 --> 02:22:24,551
Now, Moe Greene will sell us his
share of the casino and the hotel...

1559
02:22:24,656 --> 02:22:27,250
so it can be completely owned
by the family. Tom?

1560
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:29,637
Hey, Mike, are you sure about that?

1561
02:22:29,661 --> 02:22:32,528
Moe loves the business. He never
said nothin' to me about sellin'.

1562
02:22:32,631 --> 02:22:35,131
Well, I'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

1563
02:22:36,869 --> 02:22:39,280
See, Johnny...

1564
02:22:39,304 --> 02:22:41,583
see, we figure that entertainment
will be a big factor...

1565
02:22:41,607 --> 02:22:43,385
in drawing gamblers to the casino.

1566
02:22:43,409 --> 02:22:46,708
Now we hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1567
02:22:50,215 --> 02:22:53,480
Perhaps convince some of
your friends in the movies...

1568
02:22:53,585 --> 02:22:56,085
to do the same.

1569
02:22:56,155 --> 02:22:58,655
We're counting on you.

1570
02:23:00,259 --> 02:23:02,784
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1571
02:23:02,895 --> 02:23:04,205
You know that.

1572
02:23:04,229 --> 02:23:06,729
Good.

1573
02:23:06,865 --> 02:23:09,077
Hey, Mike. Hello, fellas.

1574
02:23:09,101 --> 02:23:12,798
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.
Good to see you, Mike.

1575
02:23:12,905 --> 02:23:14,916
- How are you, Moe?
- You got everything you want?

1576
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:17,820
The chef cooked for you special, the
dancers will kick your tongue out...

1577
02:23:17,844 --> 02:23:19,487
and your credit is good.

1578
02:23:19,511 --> 02:23:22,152
Draw chips for everybody in the room
so they can play on the house.

1579
02:23:25,717 --> 02:23:28,217
My credit good enough
to buy you out?

1580
02:23:30,189 --> 02:23:32,100
Buy me out?

1581
02:23:32,124 --> 02:23:34,786
The casino. The hotel.

1582
02:23:34,893 --> 02:23:37,657
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1583
02:23:37,763 --> 02:23:40,630
The Corleone family
wants to buy me out?

1584
02:23:40,732 --> 02:23:43,232
No, I buy you out.
You don't buy me out.

1585
02:23:43,268 --> 02:23:46,533
Your casino loses money.
Maybe we can do better.

1586
02:23:46,638 --> 02:23:49,138
You think I'm skimming
off the top, Mike?

1587
02:23:49,942 --> 02:23:52,442
You're unlucky.

1588
02:23:55,614 --> 02:23:58,059
You goddamn guineas
really make me laugh.

1589
02:23:58,083 --> 02:24:00,916
I do you a favor and take Freddy in
when you're having a bad time.

1590
02:24:01,019 --> 02:24:03,465
- And then you try to push me out!
- Wait a minute.

1591
02:24:03,489 --> 02:24:06,083
You took Freddy in because
the Corleone family...

1592
02:24:06,191 --> 02:24:08,691
bankrolled your casino,
because the Molinari family...

1593
02:24:08,794 --> 02:24:10,905
on the coast guaranteed his safety.

1594
02:24:10,929 --> 02:24:12,974
Now, we're talkin' business.
Let's talk business.

1595
02:24:12,998 --> 02:24:15,728
Yeah, let's talk business, Mike.
First of all, you're all done.

1596
02:24:15,811 --> 02:24:18,331
The Corleone family don't even have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1597
02:24:18,355 --> 02:24:21,075
The Godfather's sick, right? You're
getting chased out of New York...

1598
02:24:21,099 --> 02:24:22,617
by Barzini and the other families.

1599
02:24:22,641 --> 02:24:26,543
What do you think is going on here? You
think you can come to my hotel and take over?

1600
02:24:26,645 --> 02:24:28,456
I talked to Barzini.

1601
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:31,745
I can make a deal with him
and still keep my hotel.

1602
02:24:31,850 --> 02:24:34,444
Is that why you slapped
my brother around in public?

1603
02:24:35,521 --> 02:24:37,222
Oh, no, that was nothin', Mike.

1604
02:24:37,523 --> 02:24:40,083
Now, now, Moe didn't mean nothin' by that.

1605
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:42,670
Sure he flies off the handle
once in a while...

1606
02:24:42,694 --> 02:24:44,806
but Moe and me,
we're good friends, right, Moe, huh?

1607
02:24:44,830 --> 02:24:46,674
I got a business to run.

1608
02:24:46,698 --> 02:24:49,428
I gotta kick asses sometimes
to make it run right.

1609
02:24:49,535 --> 02:24:53,528
We had a little argument, Freddy and I,
so I had to straighten him out.

1610
02:24:53,639 --> 02:24:56,233
You straightened my brother out?

1611
02:24:56,341 --> 02:24:58,820
He was banging cocktail waitresses
two at a time!

1612
02:24:58,844 --> 02:25:01,745
Players couldn't get a drink at the table.
What's wrong with you?

1613
02:25:07,786 --> 02:25:11,278
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1614
02:25:11,390 --> 02:25:13,067
Son of a bitch.

1615
02:25:13,091 --> 02:25:16,117
Do you know who I am?
I'm Moe Greene.

1616
02:25:16,228 --> 02:25:18,822
I made my bones when you were
going out with cheerleaders.

1617
02:25:18,931 --> 02:25:21,431
Wait a minute, Moe.
Moe, I got an idea.

1618
02:25:22,434 --> 02:25:25,631
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Now, you can talk to the Don.

1619
02:25:25,737 --> 02:25:27,715
- You can explain...
- Just a minute.

1620
02:25:27,739 --> 02:25:31,334
The Don is semiretired and Mike is
in charge of the family business now.

1621
02:25:31,443 --> 02:25:34,003
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1622
02:25:38,885 --> 02:25:43,480
Mike! You don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1623
02:25:45,826 --> 02:25:50,556
Fredo. You're my older brother,
and I love you.

1624
02:25:52,064 --> 02:25:54,108
But don't ever take sides
with anyone...

1625
02:25:54,132 --> 02:25:57,033
against the family again...

1626
02:25:57,135 --> 02:25:59,635
ever.

1627
02:26:06,445 --> 02:26:08,590
I have to see my father
and his people.

1628
02:26:08,614 --> 02:26:11,114
- So have dinner without me.
- Oh, Michael.

1629
02:26:12,618 --> 02:26:14,862
This weekend we'll go out.
We'll go to the city.

1630
02:26:14,886 --> 02:26:17,386
We'll see a show and we'll have dinner.
I promise.

1631
02:26:24,830 --> 02:26:27,731
Oh, Michael. Michael, your sister wants
to ask you something.

1632
02:26:27,833 --> 02:26:29,944
- Well, let her ask.
- No, she's afraid to.

1633
02:26:29,968 --> 02:26:33,199
Connie and Carlo want you to be
godfather to their little boy.

1634
02:26:33,305 --> 02:26:35,149
- Oh, we'll see.
- Will you?

1635
02:26:35,173 --> 02:26:37,673
Let me think about it. We'll see.
Come on.

1636
02:26:44,282 --> 02:26:46,194
So...

1637
02:26:46,218 --> 02:26:49,187
Barzini will move against you first.

1638
02:26:49,287 --> 02:26:53,621
He'll set up a meeting with
someone that you absolutely trust...

1639
02:26:53,725 --> 02:26:56,225
guaranteeing your safety.

1640
02:26:57,062 --> 02:27:00,327
And at that meeting,
you'll be assassinated.

1641
02:27:04,970 --> 02:27:08,167
I like to drink wine
more than I used to.

1642
02:27:09,341 --> 02:27:11,486
Anyway, I'm drinking more.

1643
02:27:11,510 --> 02:27:14,010
It's good for you, Pop.

1644
02:27:17,949 --> 02:27:20,449
I don't know.

1645
02:27:21,353 --> 02:27:23,853
Your wife and children,
are you happy with them?

1646
02:27:25,257 --> 02:27:27,301
Very happy.

1647
02:27:27,325 --> 02:27:29,850
That's good.

1648
02:27:29,961 --> 02:27:32,206
I hope you don't mind
the way I...

1649
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:34,824
I keep going over
this Barzini business.

1650
02:27:34,933 --> 02:27:36,978
No, not at all.

1651
02:27:37,002 --> 02:27:39,347
It's an old habit.

1652
02:27:39,371 --> 02:27:42,135
I spent my life
tryin' not to be careless.

1653
02:27:44,009 --> 02:27:46,842
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1654
02:27:50,716 --> 02:27:53,276
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1655
02:27:53,385 --> 02:27:55,885
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1656
02:27:58,690 --> 02:28:00,935
He's smarter than I am.

1657
02:28:00,959 --> 02:28:03,459
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1658
02:28:05,263 --> 02:28:07,763
Reads the funny papers.

1659
02:28:14,506 --> 02:28:16,984
I want you to arrange
to have a telephone man...

1660
02:28:17,008 --> 02:28:20,136
check all the calls that go
in and out of here.

1661
02:28:20,245 --> 02:28:22,356
- I did it already, Pop.
- Could be anyone.

1662
02:28:22,380 --> 02:28:25,907
- Pop, I took care of that.
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

1663
02:28:29,621 --> 02:28:31,999
What's the matter?

1664
02:28:32,023 --> 02:28:34,523
What's bothering you?

1665
02:28:37,295 --> 02:28:39,795
I'll handle it.

1666
02:28:40,198 --> 02:28:42,698
I told you I can handle it,
I'll handle it.

1667
02:28:55,747 --> 02:29:00,081
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this...

1668
02:29:00,185 --> 02:29:02,063
and Fredo...

1669
02:29:02,087 --> 02:29:04,532
Well...

1670
02:29:04,556 --> 02:29:07,056
Fredo was...

1671
02:29:08,593 --> 02:29:11,357
But I never, I never wanted this for you.

1672
02:29:13,632 --> 02:29:16,465
I worked my whole life...
I don't apologize...

1673
02:29:16,568 --> 02:29:18,713
to take care of my family...

1674
02:29:18,737 --> 02:29:22,605
and I refused to be a fool...

1675
02:29:22,707 --> 02:29:26,768
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1676
02:29:28,880 --> 02:29:32,043
I don't apologize. That's my life.
But I thought that...

1677
02:29:34,019 --> 02:29:36,613
that when it was your time...

1678
02:29:36,721 --> 02:29:39,221
that you would be the one
to hold the strings.

1679
02:29:41,059 --> 02:29:43,559
Senator Corleone.

1680
02:29:44,529 --> 02:29:46,674
Governor Corleone. Something.

1681
02:29:46,698 --> 02:29:49,198
Another pezzonovante.

1682
02:29:54,706 --> 02:29:58,540
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1683
02:29:58,643 --> 02:30:01,237
We'll get there, Pop.

1684
02:30:01,346 --> 02:30:03,846
We'll get there.

1685
02:30:07,085 --> 02:30:11,454
Now listen. Whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting...

1686
02:30:11,556 --> 02:30:13,301
he's the traitor.

1687
02:30:13,325 --> 02:30:15,825
Don't forget that.

1688
02:30:31,576 --> 02:30:34,076
Put it over the tree.

1689
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:51,305
- Can I water these?
- Yeah.

1690
02:30:51,329 --> 02:30:52,874
That's fine.

1691
02:30:52,898 --> 02:30:55,398
Over here. Over here.

1692
02:30:57,502 --> 02:31:00,002
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1693
02:31:06,311 --> 02:31:08,811
Anthony, come here.

1694
02:31:14,219 --> 02:31:16,719
Go ahead. That's right.
We'll put it right there.

1695
02:31:22,527 --> 02:31:25,027
I'll show you something.
Come here.

1696
02:31:27,532 --> 02:31:30,032
Now, you stand there.

1697
02:31:33,138 --> 02:31:35,638
Give me an orange!

1698
02:31:53,224 --> 02:31:55,724
That's a new trick.

1699
02:31:56,294 --> 02:31:58,854
You run in there. Run in there.

1700
02:32:11,476 --> 02:32:13,976
- Where are you?
- Who?

1701
02:32:47,112 --> 02:32:49,612
Ouch!

1702
02:35:11,156 --> 02:35:13,656
Mike, can I have a minute?

1703
02:35:24,002 --> 02:35:26,447
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1704
02:35:26,471 --> 02:35:28,971
He says we can straighten
any of our problems out.

1705
02:35:30,642 --> 02:35:33,142
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1706
02:35:34,078 --> 02:35:36,490
I can arrange security...

1707
02:35:36,514 --> 02:35:39,014
on my territory.

1708
02:35:40,952 --> 02:35:42,930
All right?

1709
02:35:42,954 --> 02:35:45,787
- All right.
- All right.

1710
02:36:01,072 --> 02:36:03,572
Do you know how
they're gonna come at you?

1711
02:36:06,511 --> 02:36:08,923
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn.

1712
02:36:08,947 --> 02:36:11,447
Tessio's ground...

1713
02:36:12,317 --> 02:36:14,817
where I'll be safe.

1714
02:36:26,364 --> 02:36:29,959
I always thought it would've been
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1715
02:36:30,068 --> 02:36:32,413
It's the smart move.

1716
02:36:32,437 --> 02:36:34,937
Tessio was always smarter.

1717
02:36:36,140 --> 02:36:38,419
But I'm gonna wait.

1718
02:36:38,443 --> 02:36:40,943
After the baptism.

1719
02:36:42,914 --> 02:36:45,474
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1720
02:36:46,818 --> 02:36:49,753
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini...

1721
02:36:49,854 --> 02:36:52,299
and Tattaglia...

1722
02:36:52,323 --> 02:36:54,823
all the heads
of the five families.

1723
02:37:21,324 --> 02:37:23,324
Go forth from him, unclean spirit,

1724
02:37:23,525 --> 02:37:26,725
and give place to the Holy Spirit,
the Spirit of God.

1725
02:37:28,703 --> 02:37:29,703
Let us pray.

1726
02:37:29,727 --> 02:37:32,727
Our prayers through through
Christ our Lord. So be it.

1727
02:37:33,305 --> 02:37:34,305
Michael.

1728
02:37:34,329 --> 02:37:37,329
Signed with the sign of the Lord's cross,

1729
02:37:38,330 --> 02:37:41,307
so that, preserving this first experience
of the greatness of thy glory,

1730
02:37:41,331 --> 02:37:44,308
he may deserve, by keeping
thy commandments,

1731
02:37:44,332 --> 02:37:47,309
<i>to attain to the glory of regeneration.</i>

1732
02:37:47,333 --> 02:37:50,310
<i>Through Christ our Lord. So be it.</i>

1733
02:37:50,334 --> 02:37:53,311
<i>Let us pray.
Almighty, everlasting God,</i>

1734
02:37:53,335 --> 02:37:55,812
<i>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</i>

1735
02:37:55,836 --> 02:37:58,813
<i>look graciously down upon this,
thy servant, Michael.</i>

1736
02:37:58,837 --> 02:38:01,814
Who shall come to judge the living
and the dead,

1737
02:38:01,838 --> 02:38:04,815
and the world by fire. So be it.

1738
02:38:04,839 --> 02:38:07,116
Michael. Receive the salt of wisdom.

1739
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:09,417
Let it be to thee a token of mercy
unto everlasting life.

1740
02:38:09,441 --> 02:38:11,481
May it make your way easy to eternal life.
So be it.

1741
02:38:11,505 --> 02:38:13,919
May the almighty God, the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

1742
02:38:13,943 --> 02:38:16,443
<i>Who hath regenerated thee by water
and the Holy Spirit,</i>

1743
02:38:17,444 --> 02:38:19,944
<i>and who hath given thee the
remission of all thy sins,</i>

1744
02:38:20,445 --> 02:38:23,922
<i>may he, himself anoint thee with
the Chrism of Salvation,</i>

1745
02:38:23,946 --> 02:38:26,946
<i>in the same Christ Jesus our Lord,
unto life eternal. So be it.</i>

1746
02:38:27,947 --> 02:38:31,247
I annoint you with the oil of salvation
in Christ Jesus our Lord,

1747
02:38:31,548 --> 02:38:34,548
that you may have everlasting life.
So be it.

1748
02:38:41,949 --> 02:38:44,926
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1749
02:38:44,950 --> 02:38:47,927
<i>the communion of Saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1750
02:38:47,951 --> 02:38:51,451
<i>the resurrection of the body
and life everlasting? I do believe.</i>

1751
02:38:52,452 --> 02:38:55,429
I exorcise thee, unclean spirit,
in the name of the Father,

1752
02:38:55,453 --> 02:38:58,430
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,

1753
02:38:58,454 --> 02:39:02,431
that thou goest out and depart from
this servant of God, Michael.

1754
02:39:02,455 --> 02:39:05,955
For he commands thee, accursed one,

1755
02:39:07,756 --> 02:39:10,733
Be opened, for an odor of sweetness.

1756
02:39:10,757 --> 02:39:13,734
Be thou, devil, begone,

1757
02:39:13,758 --> 02:39:16,058
for the judgment of God shall draw near.

1758
02:39:16,100 --> 02:39:19,001
Michael, do you believe in God,
the Father almighty...

1759
02:39:19,103 --> 02:39:22,072
- creator of Heaven and Earth?
- I do.

1760
02:39:22,173 --> 02:39:25,472
<i>Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
his only Son, our Lord?</i>

1761
02:39:25,576 --> 02:39:27,054
<i>I do.</i>

1762
02:39:27,078 --> 02:39:31,225
<i>Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?</i>

1763
02:39:31,249 --> 02:39:32,249
<i>I do.</i>

1764
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:36,427
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.</i>

1765
02:39:36,451 --> 02:39:40,428
<i>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.</i>

1766
02:39:40,452 --> 02:39:43,229
<i>Give us this day our daily bread.</i>

1767
02:39:43,253 --> 02:39:45,253
<i>And forgive us our trespasses,</i>

1768
02:39:45,454 --> 02:39:48,524
<i>as we forgive them that
trespass against us.</i>

1769
02:39:48,548 --> 02:39:51,525
<i>And lead us not into temptation,</i>

1770
02:39:51,549 --> 02:39:53,526
<i>but deliver us from evil.
So be it.</i>

1771
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:55,027
Michael.

1772
02:39:55,051 --> 02:39:58,028
Enter thou into the temple of God,

1773
02:39:58,052 --> 02:40:01,029
that thou mayest have part with Christ
unto life everlasting. So be it.

1774
02:40:01,053 --> 02:40:03,530
I believe in God the Father almighty,

1775
02:40:03,554 --> 02:40:05,531
Creator of heaven and earth,

1776
02:40:05,555 --> 02:40:09,032
<i>and in Jesus Christ his only
son our Lord,</i>

1777
02:40:09,056 --> 02:40:11,333
<i>who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,</i>

1778
02:40:11,357 --> 02:40:13,334
<i>born of the Virgin Mary,</i>

1779
02:40:13,358 --> 02:40:16,636
<i>suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead, and buried.</i>

1780
02:40:16,660 --> 02:40:19,337
<i>He descended into Hell.
On the third day,</i>

1781
02:40:19,361 --> 02:40:23,338
<i>He rose again from the dead.
He ascended into heaven,</i>

1782
02:40:23,362 --> 02:40:26,139
<i>and sitteth at the right hand of
God the Father almighty,</i>

1783
02:40:26,163 --> 02:40:28,640
<i>from thence shall he come to judge
the living and the dead.</i>

1784
02:40:28,664 --> 02:40:31,641
<i>I believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church,</i>

1785
02:40:31,665 --> 02:40:34,642
<i>the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,</i>

1786
02:40:34,666 --> 02:40:37,466
<i>the resurrection of the body,
and life everlasting. So be it.</i>

1787
02:40:37,548 --> 02:40:42,485
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1788
02:40:48,893 --> 02:40:51,393
I do renounce him.

1789
02:40:59,704 --> 02:41:02,204
And all his works?

1790
02:41:14,418 --> 02:41:16,918
I do renounce them.

1791
02:41:21,792 --> 02:41:25,751
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1792
02:41:41,145 --> 02:41:45,206
Michael Rizzi,
will you be baptized?

1793
02:41:45,316 --> 02:41:47,293
I will.

1794
02:41:47,317 --> 02:41:49,594
In the name of the Father,

1795
02:41:49,618 --> 02:41:51,595
<i>and of the Son,</i>

1796
02:41:51,619 --> 02:41:54,019
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

1797
02:41:54,358 --> 02:41:56,918
<i>Michael Rizzi, go in peace.</i>

1798
02:41:57,028 --> 02:42:00,054
And may the Lord be with you.
So be it.

1799
02:42:42,173 --> 02:42:44,151
- Carlo.
- What?

1800
02:42:44,175 --> 02:42:46,386
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1801
02:42:46,410 --> 02:42:48,422
Everybody's gonna have to leave
without us.

1802
02:42:48,446 --> 02:42:51,006
- It's our first vacation together.
- Connie, please.

1803
02:42:51,115 --> 02:42:53,093
- What do you wanna do?
- Go back to the house.

1804
02:42:53,117 --> 02:42:55,984
Wait for my call.
It's important.

1805
02:42:56,087 --> 02:42:58,587
I'll only be a couple of days.

1806
02:43:01,025 --> 02:43:03,525
Have a nice trip, Mama.

1807
02:43:14,538 --> 02:43:17,038
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1808
02:43:18,876 --> 02:43:21,254
I hope Mike can get us
a good deal tonight.

1809
02:43:21,278 --> 02:43:23,778
I'm sure he will.

1810
02:43:30,521 --> 02:43:33,547
Sal, Tom, the boss says
he'll come in a separate car.

1811
02:43:33,658 --> 02:43:35,836
He says for you two
to go on ahead.

1812
02:43:35,860 --> 02:43:38,488
Hell, he can't do that.
It screws up all my arrangements.

1813
02:43:38,596 --> 02:43:41,096
- Well that's what he said.
- I can't go either, Sal.

1814
02:43:53,711 --> 02:43:56,475
Tell Mike it was only business.

1815
02:43:56,580 --> 02:43:59,080
I always liked him.

1816
02:43:59,250 --> 02:44:01,750
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1817
02:44:08,159 --> 02:44:10,659
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1818
02:44:11,762 --> 02:44:14,458
- For old times' sake.
- Can't do it, Sally.

1819
02:45:00,411 --> 02:45:02,911
You have to answer
for Santino, Carlo.

1820
02:45:07,818 --> 02:45:09,629
Mike, you got it all wrong.

1821
02:45:09,653 --> 02:45:12,153
You fingered Sonny
for the Barzini people.

1822
02:45:13,758 --> 02:45:16,818
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1823
02:45:16,927 --> 02:45:18,905
Did you think that could fool
a Corleone?

1824
02:45:18,929 --> 02:45:22,092
Mike, I'm innocent.
I swear on the kids.

1825
02:45:22,199 --> 02:45:24,699
- Please, don't do this to me.
- Sit down.

1826
02:45:27,838 --> 02:45:30,338
Don't do this to me, please.

1827
02:45:39,216 --> 02:45:41,716
Barzini's dead.

1828
02:45:42,887 --> 02:45:45,387
So is Phillip Tattaglia...

1829
02:45:46,590 --> 02:45:49,069
Moe Greene...

1830
02:45:49,093 --> 02:45:51,593
Stracci...

1831
02:45:52,163 --> 02:45:54,663
Cuneo.

1832
02:45:54,732 --> 02:45:58,224
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1833
02:46:00,104 --> 02:46:02,604
Admit what you did.

1834
02:46:05,743 --> 02:46:08,243
Get him a drink.

1835
02:46:13,884 --> 02:46:16,296
Come on.

1836
02:46:16,320 --> 02:46:18,698
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1837
02:46:18,722 --> 02:46:21,222
Come on. You think I'd make my sister
a widow?

1838
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:25,360
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1839
02:46:32,503 --> 02:46:33,814
Go ahead, drink.

1840
02:46:33,838 --> 02:46:36,338
Drink.

1841
02:46:39,410 --> 02:46:41,555
Now, Carlo, you're out
of the family business.

1842
02:46:41,579 --> 02:46:45,242
That's your punishment.
You're finished.

1843
02:46:45,349 --> 02:46:47,849
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1844
02:46:54,091 --> 02:46:57,492
I want you to stay there.
Understand?

1845
02:46:57,595 --> 02:47:00,095
Only don't tell me
you're innocent...

1846
02:47:01,665 --> 02:47:04,634
because it insults my intelligence.

1847
02:47:04,735 --> 02:47:07,235
It makes me very angry.

1848
02:47:10,140 --> 02:47:13,371
Now, who approached you?

1849
02:47:13,477 --> 02:47:15,977
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1850
02:47:23,120 --> 02:47:25,620
It was Barzini.

1851
02:47:28,058 --> 02:47:30,558
Good.

1852
02:47:37,201 --> 02:47:39,863
There's a car waiting for you
outside to take you to the airport.

1853
02:47:41,305 --> 02:47:43,805
I'll call your wife,
tell her what flight you're on.

1854
02:47:49,413 --> 02:47:51,913
- Please, can I...
- Get out of my sight.

1855
02:48:17,374 --> 02:48:19,874
Hello, Carlo.

1856
02:49:16,400 --> 02:49:19,198
Will you stop crying?
What are you trying to tell me?

1857
02:49:19,303 --> 02:49:22,101
- I'm trying to tell you you're wrong.
- Mama, please!

1858
02:49:30,516 --> 02:49:32,516
Michael! Michael!

1859
02:49:33,017 --> 02:49:35,517
Where is he?

1860
02:49:37,421 --> 02:49:42,449
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband!

1861
02:49:42,559 --> 02:49:45,153
You waited until Papa died
so nobody could stop you...

1862
02:49:45,262 --> 02:49:46,773
and then you killed him!

1863
02:49:46,797 --> 02:49:49,925
You blamed him for Sonny.
You always did. Everybody did.

1864
02:49:50,034 --> 02:49:53,663
But you never thought about me!
You never gave a damn about me!

1865
02:49:53,771 --> 02:49:56,271
Now what am I gonna do?

1866
02:49:59,977 --> 02:50:02,477
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the mall?

1867
02:50:02,546 --> 02:50:05,106
All the time he knew
he was gonna kill him.

1868
02:50:05,215 --> 02:50:08,309
And you stood godfather
to our baby.

1869
02:50:08,419 --> 02:50:10,730
You lousy, coldhearted bastard.

1870
02:50:10,754 --> 02:50:13,254
Want to know how many men
he had killed with Carlo?

1871
02:50:13,290 --> 02:50:15,035
Read the papers!
Read the papers!

1872
02:50:15,059 --> 02:50:17,559
That's your husband!
That's your husband!

1873
02:50:31,141 --> 02:50:33,641
Take her upstairs.

1874
02:50:33,677 --> 02:50:36,177
- Get her a doctor.
- Oh, God!

1875
02:50:56,233 --> 02:50:58,733
She's hysterical.

1876
02:51:02,673 --> 02:51:05,173
Hysterical.

1877
02:51:06,176 --> 02:51:08,676
Michael, is it true?

1878
02:51:10,114 --> 02:51:12,158
Don't ask me about my business, Kay.

1879
02:51:12,182 --> 02:51:15,674
- Is it true?
- Don't ask me about my business.

1880
02:51:15,786 --> 02:51:18,286
- No.
- Enough!

1881
02:51:36,673 --> 02:51:39,173
All right.

1882
02:51:40,978 --> 02:51:43,478
This one time.

1883
02:51:46,683 --> 02:51:49,183
This one time, I'll let you
ask me about my affairs.

1884
02:51:55,726 --> 02:51:58,226
Is it true?

1885
02:52:01,832 --> 02:52:04,332
Is it?

1886
02:52:04,633 --> 02:52:06,133
No.

1887
02:52:19,850 --> 02:52:22,228
I guess we both need a drink, huh?

1888
02:52:22,252 --> 02:52:24,752
Come on.

1889
02:52:54,318 --> 02:52:56,818
Don Corleone.
