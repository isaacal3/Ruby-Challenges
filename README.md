# Ruby Programming Challenge for Newbies

Go to [RPCFN](http://ruby-challenge.rubylearning.com), and solve too!

RPCFN is a good idea as reading books and documentation can only take you so far
when learning a new language. To really learn, you need to use the language.
RPCFN provides a fabulous forum for using Ruby in the form of regular, engaging
(but not arcanely difficult) challenges. Better yet, it provides feedback on how
to use Ruby well, as each fortnight the best solution to a challenge is chosen.
RPCFN is a wonderful introduction to the Ruby language and to the Ruby
community.
